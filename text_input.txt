India Prefers to
Travel with us
IndiGo is India’s most preferred airline
which offers affordable fares, flights that are
on-time, and provides a courteous and hassle-free
service across our unparalleled network.
From a carrier with one plane to a
fleet of 300+ aircraft today. This
fabulous evolution was driven by
several factors: uniform fleet for
every operation, great operational
reliability and award-winning
services. We primarily serve India’s
domestic air travel market yet we
have strong international ambitions
and are continually increasing
our footprint.
We constantly enhance engagement
with our passengers to augment
their travel experience. From
multichannel direct sales, online
flight status checking to an exclusive

IndiGo app for Android and iOS, we
have enriched and popularised air travel
in India. We show that low cost does
not mean low quality.

Annual Report 2022-23

CEO’s Perspective

Dear Shareholders,
It is a genuine privilege for me to share
my thoughts with you, for the first time
in this annual report. Ever since my start
at IndiGo in September 2022, I have
been equally excited and proud to be a
part of this wonderful company.
Aviation has had a hold on me ever
since I joined the industry over 30 years
ago, back in 1992. At IndiGo the
entrepreneurial spirit, the energy and
passion displayed by our employees,
combined with the rich diversity of India
have been a true pleasure for me that
I intend to enjoy for long.
The financial year 2023 was a year of
first recovery and thereafter growth. In
the first half of the year, the path to
recovery became clearly visible when
the impact of Covid-19 subsided and
travel restrictions were lifted. As a

04

result, travel rebounded at an
extraordinary speed and scale. In the
second half of 2022, a lot of exciting
things have been launched and
implemented at IndiGo, which we will
share throughout this annual report.
Consequently, and proudly, IndiGo
became the first Indian airline to
surpass pre-covid levels of capacity,
taking us into the highest passenger
number ever - of 86 million for the
Financial Year 2023. The relentless
efforts of our professional and resilient
employees enabled us to emerge
stronger after this period of crisis.
As a result of the improved external
environment and a wide range of
internal initiatives that were taken
as part of the new IndiGo strategy,
IndiGo’s financial performance
considerably improved in FY 2023.
Our revenues more than doubled as
compared to last year and we also

As a result of the
improved external
environment and as
part of the new IndiGo
strategy, IndiGo’s
financial performance

reported the highest ever annual
revenues of 558.8 billion rupees. With
that, the year had two very distinct
halves.
The first two quarters we still suffered
losses, yet we were recovering. The
third and fourth quarter were profitable,

Corporate Overview

an important milestone after some
10 quarters of losses due to Covid-19.

Giving wings to the
nation
Right from IndiGo’s start, it has been
our mission to connect the vast and
diverse India, supporting social
cohesion, mobility and economic
progress. IndiGo’s journey started
almost 17 years ago with one aircraft
and a flight to Imphal via Guwahati.
At the end of FY 2023, we operated
more than 1,800 daily flights, covering
104 destinations, with our fleet of more
than 300+ planes. With our vast network
we are literally giving wings to the
nation, enabling air travel to all large,
medium, and smaller cities across India.
Our many first-time flyers are a true
testimony to this, just as the businesses
that can flourish as a result of all these
connections.
Over the past few months, we have
built upon the existing beliefs of the
organization to come up with a purpose.
Building upon our strong cultural
foundation, we have formulated it as
such: ‘Giving wings to the nation, by
connecting people and aspirations’. This
something we have lived by since our
inception and which we continue to fuel
going forward.
Fulfilling our purpose has provided us
with a place of reckoning in the global
aviation industry. With our 1,800+
flights we are in FY 2023 the 7th largest
in the world by daily departures. We
were number one in India by OTP (On
Time Performance) in the last two
quarters of this financial year, and we
have one of the highest OTP in the
world. We have the largest fleet order
to be delivered of almost 500 aircraft
between FY 2024 and the end of the
decade. We also have the youngest
fleet in the world with an average age
of around 3.5 years. We are India’s
most preferred airline and fully intend to

maintain this position. With more and
more international mobility in and out
of India, we aim to extend our scope.
And so, our vision is this: To be India’s
preferred airline for connectivity in and
with India, by doing so being one of the
leading airlines in the world. This is also
briefly captured as ‘India by IndiGo’.

Soaring towards new
heights and across new
frontiers
In FY 2023 we formulated, communicated
and started to execute our new strategy
of Towards new heights & across new
frontiers. This will be for the years to
come, the next chapter of the inspiring
IndiGo story. We have identified three
pillars for our (growth) strategy Reassure, Develop and Create - which
we will focus on in parallel. The wide
range of initiatives that were collectively
set in motion across our Company
under these three pillars have already
started to yield results in all areas as
became visible in both the financial
results as well as important KPI’s such
as NPS and OTP.

Our vision is
to be India’s
preferred airline
for connectivity
in and with India,
by doing so
being one of the
leading airlines
in the world. This
is also brieﬂy
captured as
‘India by IndiGo’

Reassure
This first pillar of the strategy is about
reassuring - and improving where
needed - the very basis of our Company.
The focus on our three customer
promises - affordable fares,
on time performance and courteous and
hassle-free service - have been at the
basis of our success. Over the past year
we have added a fourth promise:
unparalleled network. Naturally, above
all, safety is and will remain our number
one priority.
Indeed, the very consistent delivery of
our customer promises has enabled us
to grow. In FY 2023, we welcomed
around 86 million customers on board,
which is a 72% jump as compared
to the previous year and a 14 percent
jump as compared to the previous
pre-covid record year FY 2020.

We also improved our operational
performance, which has been one of our
core strengths. Thanks to great efforts
made by our staff, we were able to get
back into the number one OTP position in
November and have held onto it for most
of the remainder of the financial year.
Additionally, we have had one of the
lowest cancellation rates globally in this
year. In November, our new hangar at
Bengaluru airport opened to support our
continuously growing fleet. To mark our
sixteenth anniversary in August 2022, we
introduced a new revolutionary Three
Point Disembarkation process which
enables our customers to exit the aircraft
faster than ever before. Being the first
airline in the world to use this process, we
have exhibited it at the cover page of this
annual report.

05

InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Annual Report 2022-23

The reliability of operations in
combination with the service from the
heart of our crew has led to higher
customer satisfaction (NPS = Net
Promotor Score). To improve our
courteous and hassle-free service we
have been simplifying our processes. In
this financial year, our customer
complaints remained at an all-time low.
At the end of FY 2023, we had presence
in 104 destinations as we added 5
domestic and 2 international
destinations, such as Ras Al Khaimah,
Itanagar, Mopa-Goa, Nashik and
Dharamshala. With our 1,800 flights a
day we are able to offer almost 500
direct city pairs each day. Domestic
connectivity remains a crucial part of our
strategy going forward and we will
keep on adding more and more
domestic destinations to our network –
further giving wings to the nation.

Develop
On our second pillar, by the end of the
decade we will double in size. Herewith
we will have to further develop and
align people, processes and technology in
line with this growing size and scale
of our Company. Digitization plays a
pivotal role in this. The actions we take
in this second pillar will create the
stability, structures and processes to
help us steer the company on the path
to our aspirations. In FY 2023, we have
already been taking steps: we have
upgraded the back-end of our website,
developed an in-house ‘Partnership
Booking Engine’, introduced RIFD
technology that reduces the inspection
time for life vests and introduced the
e-logbook for pilots. We are investing in
an HR management system, a new CRM
and core digital platforms to enhance
scalability and customer experience.
Next to this, we are also developing our
people. Considering the large extent of
hiring, creating the right skills and
competencies will remain of great
importance. We are proud to have ifly,
one of the largest aviation training
academies in the world, where the
IndiGo spirit is created for over 1,850
people a day. Over the years a strong
IndiGo culture has been build and
nurtured. Made in IndiGo is one of the
programs that makes me very proud to
be part of this company as we give
room for the talent that is inside our

06

home-grown 6E employees. We have
seen an uptick in our recent employee
promotor scores (eNPS) and are
continuing to build on initiatives that
strengthen our employee engagement
and talent management.
At IndiGo, we value diversity, equity
and inclusion, and are focused on
creating a safe and conducive space for
all employees. With 15% women in the
cockpit, we are proud to have the
highest number of women pilots in the
world, for which we were felicitated by
the Indian Women Pilots’ Association.
In 2022, we joined International Air
Transport Association (IATA) 25 by 2025
initiative that focuses on increasing
female leadership to 25% to become
one of the change agents in the aviation
industry in order to make it truly diverse
and inclusive along with other airlines
and industry partners. Further, we are
determined to push our 45% overall
female share even further up through
several programmes and initiatives such
as “Take-Off 2.0” - a programme which
provides opportunities to women who
have been on a career break. These
programmes and initiatives underpin
IndiGo’s commitment to being an equal
opportunity employer.

Turkish Airlines we are strengthening
our international connectivity from India
by providing services to 33 additional
European destinations and 4 additional
destinations in the US. Next, we damp
leased B777 from Turkish Airlines. This
enabled us to operate a widebody to
Istanbul, the perfect entry point to Europe.
A second B777 - proudly in our own liveryarrived in the current financial year.
Apart from this, we are leveraging
our existing platform for growth. With
India emerging as a major electronics
manufacturing hub, the country’s air cargo
network will become a critical enabler of
its success. We have supplemented our
business with two narrow body freighters
to support India’s cargo growth and an
additional one is planned to arrive later
this year.
At the same time, we are taking steps
to complement our business with a
customer loyalty program, and strengthen
our co-brand card programme, to enable
us to provide a differentiated customer
experience, and create further stickiness
to our brand.
In sum, all three pillars - Reassure,
Develop and Create - are starting to
bear fruit.

Create
The third pillar in our strategy will create
our future towards the next phase of
our growth combining our strong Indian
foundation with international aspirations.
Apart from an unparalleled domestic
network, we continue to strengthen our
international network by introducing
new destinations and frequencies. At
the end of the financial year, we had
presence in 26 international destinations,
and surely this number will go up in
the years to come. As a share of the
capacity the international capacity
(Available Seat Kilometre - ASK) will
reach towards 30% in the next two years.
Towards this goal, early June 2023 we
have announced 6 new international
destinations namely Nairobi, Jakarta,
Baku, Tashkent, Tbilisi and Almaty. We
are taking steps to prepare our sales
and distribution for further international
presence. These are exciting steps as
we are connecting the world to India,
one dot at a time. In addition to our
own network, we are enhancing our
connectivity with our strategic partners.
With our codeshare agreement with

Our ESG initiatives IndiGo Green
At IndiGo, we strive to deliver our
customer promise in the most sustainable
way possible. With our investments in the
new generation aircraft, we have been
able to reduce CO2 footprint by around
20% in FY 2023 as compared to 7 years
ago. Today, around 80% of our fleet is
new generation and due to that, we are
one of the lowest CO2 emitting airlines
in the world.
Apart from this, sustainability is
integrated at the operational level and
we are making a series of investments
towards more responsible flying including
single engine taxiing, optimal climb and
descent paths, introduction of electric
ground vehicles, combo units, electronic
flight bags and water conservation
techniques on-board.

Corporate Overview

Reaching out to people
not only with planes but
also with our hearts
Being a responsible airline, we believe
that CSR is an important aspect of our
growth going forward. Our CSR arm,
IndiGoReach, contributes towards the
goal of sustainable development for
communities. It has four focus areas which
cover children and education, women
empowerment, environment, and heritage.
With different programmes being
implemented across 18 Indian states
we have been able to reach over 1 lakh
(100,000) beneficiaries. It is immensely
gratifying to have been awarded with the
prestigious “Best CSR Award for Women
Empowerment” by FICCI.
IndiGo remains committed to supporting
humanitarian causes in India and across
the world. Recently, we supported the
Indian government in “Operation Kaveri”,
in bringing over hundreds of Indian
citizens back to their homeland from
the crisis hit Sudan. Earlier in the year,
with Turkey being hit by devastating
earthquakes, we provided cargo
movement on our flights to Istanbul.

Recognitions from around
the world
As India’s most preferred airline, we
were recognized by several reputed
organizations from around the world.
These awards are a testament of our
commitment to operational excellence,
and I am proud to name a few of them:
-W
 e were awarded with “World’s
Youngest Aircraft Fleet” in the 100+
aircraft category by ch-aviation.
- We
 were ranked as the 5th most
punctual mega airline in the world by the
Official Aviation Guide (OAG).
-W
 e were awarded as the “Best Low-Cost
Airlines in India and South Asia” by
SkyTrax.

Power of We
All this has been made possible by the
“Power of We” – the teamwork displayed
by our employees across departments and

locations. Our core strength lies in our
highly skilled, motivated, and engaged
employees, who enable us to deliver the
courteous and hassle-free service to the 3
lakh (300,000) passengers flying with us
each day (milestone reached on May 21,
2023). I would like to extend my thanks to
all IndiGo employees for demonstrating
our true culture and spirit.

Way forward
Moving to the next fiscal year, we are very
much energized by the growth path ahead
of us, climbing towards new heights and
across new frontiers. The demand for air
travel remains robust, and the overall
operating environment remains conducive.
The vision of the government on India’s
growth and progress, and aviation as one
of the catalysts for this, is benefitting
the nation as well as the hospitality
and aviation sector. The investments we
are making in people and infrastructure
will ensure that IndiGo remains wellpositioned for a strong future growth.
In June 2023 we have set a truly
momentous step in the journey of IndiGo
as we placed a firm order for 500 Airbus
of the A320 Family. This 500 aircraft
order is not only IndiGo’s largest order,
but also the largest-ever single aircraft
purchase by any airline with Airbus. With
this order of 500 aircraft to be delivered
between 2030 and 2035, IndiGo’s order
book now has almost a 1,000 aircraft yet
to be delivered well into the next decade,
allowing us to become a global aviation
player.
Just as the efforts of our resilient and
dedicated employees enabled us to
emerge stronger after a period of crisis,
the same will take us to the next phase of
growth that has already started for both
Indian aviation as well as IndiGo. With
India being the fastest growing aviation
market globally, and receiving strong
support from the government to improve
infrastructure and connectivity, the coming
years we will be able to further give
wings to the nation, by connecting people
and aspirations. By the time you have
read this annual report, a lot of exciting
things will have happened at IndiGo
already. I would kindly encourage you to
stay tuned on our website and our social
channels for more invigorating news as
we go in this financial year. In FY 2024,

Mitigating our impact
on the environment
IndiGo understands the importance of environmental
stewardship and recognises that the aviation
industry plays a significant role in contributing to
greenhouse gas emissions, which have a detrimental
impact on the environment. As a responsible
corporate citizen, we are committed to reducing our
carbon footprint and implementing sustainable
practices to mitigate our impact on the environment.
In line with this commitment, we have adopted
various initiatives and measures to reduce our
emissions and mitigate our environmental impact.
We continue to invest in contemporary and fuelefficient fleet. In FY 2023, 80% of our fleet was Airbus
A320NEO aircraft which are 15% fuel efficient, when
compared to older generation aircraft. With a fleet
age of 3.5 years, we have the youngest fleet in the
world, with 100+ aircraft1. Our operations team
continuously monitors our fuel-related SOPs and
practices like single engine taxi, optimum flap
settings, and optimum climb and descent profiles.
This help us in maintaining a low carbon emissions
profile.
Our ground operations are working on a focused
electrification strategy. For many years we have
been investing heavily on electric vehicles (EVs).
Our new vehicle purchases, whether for growth or
re-fleeting, gravitate towards EVs, subject to
corresponding airport infrastructure. As a result of our
combined actions across the board, we have achieved CO2
emission reduction 20% from FY 2016 onwards.

As per IATA and certain other studies, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) results in 80% lower emissions on a life cycle assessment basis.
IndiGo is committed and focused in deploying SAF as alternative fuel option. Towards this end, we have partnered with an organisation
to conduct research in this field, and a leading oil marketing company has initiated work on commissioning a plant. This is welcome
news for the industry and will help airlines deploy sustainable fuel options.
Additionally, through our continuous focus on elimination of Single Use Plastic we have replaced 83 million single use plastic (SUP) items
with biodegradable options. We believe that sustainable practices are essential for the long-term success of our company, and the
aviation industry as a whole. We remain committed to identify and implement eco-friendly initiatives and practices that align with
our values and contribute to a cleaner and greener future.

Global economic review

Real GDP growth (%)

The CY 2022 witnessed easing of Covid-19 restrictions
worldwide leading to a notable rise in household
consumption across major economies. The third quarter
was a bright spot with robust economic activity on the
back of stronger-than-expected private consumption,
investment amid tight labour markets and fiscal support
exceeding all expectations. Demand in most sectors,
particularly in the services sector including tourism,
witnessed growth. The year also saw geopolitical
tensions starting in the first half which caused inflation
to rise due to which the central banks across countries
resorted to somewhat synchronised monetary
tightening.

Global Economy

As per World Economic Outlook (WEO) , April 2023
published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
global real GDP growth is expected to moderate further
from 3.4% in CY 2022 to 2.8% in CY 2023. Emerging
markets and developing economies are likely to
remain robust and grow at 3.9% in CY 2023 which is a
marginal decrease from 4.0% in CY 2022.

Indian economic review
As per the IMF, for FY 2023 India was one
of the fastest growing economies with real
GDP growing at 6.8% year-on-year. During
the year, the growth was fuelled by private
consumption, growing manufacturing activity
and the revival of the service sector. The
Government of India’s sustained focus on
infrastructure investment drove economic
growth leading to employment generation.
The service sector was observed to have
fully recovered from the weakness suffered
during the pandemic.
Like many other Central Banks across
developed economies, the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) increased the repo rate on
multiple occasions since May 2022 amounting
to a cumulative increase of 250 bps in FY
2023. These efforts managed to bring retail
inflation below the upper tolerance target
set by the RBI in November-December, 2022
before breaching the threshold of 6% in
January-February, 2023. In the most recent
review, the Monetary Policy Committee
unanimously decided to keep policy repo
rate unchanged.

Purchasing Managers’ Index manufacturing remained robust at 56.4 in March 2023 recording
expansion for 21st consecutive month. PMI services also remained in the expansion zone at
57.8 in March 2023 and February 2023 witnessed the strongest expansion in 12 years at
59.4 driven by favourable demand conditions and new business gains.
India continues to maintain its position as one of the fastest growing economies backed
by robust domestic demand, fiscal expenditure and healthy corporate profits. As per IMF,
real GDP growth in India during FY 2024, is expected to be

Industry overview
Global aviation industry
Global aviation is on a path of recovery
from the pandemic years. The swift
reopening of air transport markets over
the course of CY 2022 was matched by the
appetite for travel among consumers across
most parts of the globe.
In CY 2021, the recovery of demand from
the pandemic years was driven primarily by
large domestic markets. During CY 2022, the
global aviation industry inched up further
on its road to recovery despite operating in
a challenging macroeconomic environment
on the back of inflationary pressures, rising
interest rates and rising fuel prices. The
continued recovery was observed in intraEurope, Americas and Transatlantic traffic,
which was significant (nearing CY 2019
levels) despite the Omicron wave at the
start of the year.
As per International Air Transport
Association, recovery in global air transport
demand for the CY 2022,
as measured by Revenue Passenger
Kilometres (RPK), stood at 68.5%

compared to the CY 2019. This was primarily due to removal of travel restrictions and vaccine
rollouts in densely populated nations. Air cargo capacity measured by Available Cargo Tonne
Kilometres (ACTK) bounced back remarkably well, though it remained below the pre-pandemic
level.

While certain regions may witness a
slowdown, the pent-up demand and greater
demand for travel imply that CY 2023 will
continue to see a robust worldwide recovery,
with Asia, in particular, driving significant
growth and opportunities in the global
aviation industry. The desire and need to
travel by air remain strong therefore robust
demand will be a common occurrence wherever
travel restrictions are taken down, and routes
are re-opened. According to IATA, global
passenger demand is predicted to reach

Growth drivers
Under penetration and
favourable demographics
India’s domestic passenger market
witnessed an impressive

13% CAGR

over FY 2010
– FY 2019, yet India still remains highly
underpenetrated in terms of air travel.
With rise in disposable incomes, rapid
urbanisation and increase in working class
population, the growth in the demand for
air travel is expected to persist.

Pivotal role of Tier 2
and Tier 3 cities
Historically, economic activity in India was
mainly concentrated in a small number
of cities primarily categorised as Tier 1.
Greater spread of economic activity, rising
income levels and expanding population in
Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities are providing for a
noticeable shift in this concentration. In line
with this development, the Ministry of Civil
Aviation (MoCA) is focusing on expanding
and modernising the aviation network in
Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. IndiGo remains
committed to enhance connectivity to these
Tier 2, and Tier 3 cities.

Expansion of regional
connectivity
Under the UDAN scheme, the Government
of India plans to develop

100 new airports
by 2024 and operationalise

1,000 regional
routes.
Airlines are deploying new capacity
to these previously unexplored and
inaccessible destinations and routes.
Union Budget allocation for the
FY 2024 for the Regional Connectivity
Scheme (‘UDAN’) amounted to
Rs. 1,244.07 crore. Till March 31, 2023,
more than c.12 million passengers
have travelled as beneficiaries of this
initiative.

Company overview
Increased investment
in infrastructure
The Government of India has also
announced plans to invest Rs. 1 trillion on
airport development and modernisation
over the next five years. In addition, the
government plans to increase the number
of airports from

140 220

to
by 2025.
Inauguration of two major secondary
airports such as the Noida International
Airport and Navi Mumbai International
Airport, will add substantial capacity to
the already congested primary airports
in Delhi and Mumbai respectively. With
a keen interest from the private sector, it
is evident that both the government and
business sector are making significant
investments in airport infrastructure in
India. This will improve airport facilities,
increase capacity, and enhance the overall
passenger experience, thereby driving
growth in the aviation industry.

Investments
in capacity
Compared to an operational fleet of
around 600 aircraft at the end of FY 2023,
it is estimated that a fleet of

4,000 aircraft

would
be needed in India within the next two
decades to match anticipated growth in
demand. Currently, the domestic players
collectively have an outstanding order
book of c.1,800 aircraft, which is expected
to support some of this expected growth
in demand.

Huge potential in
international market
A large chunk of outbound and inbound
international passenger demand in
India is currently catered to by foreign
carriers via international hubs, which
in turn presents an opportunity for
domestic carriers to capture a higher
share of this fast-growing market.

Incorporated in 2006, IndiGo is the largest
airline in India with 1,800+ daily flights
covering 78 domestic destinations and 26
international destinations. IndiGo’s purpose

million. Total debt for the Company was
Rs. 448,542 million, including capitalised

million, as of March 31, 2023.

Risk management
The Company has adopted a robust risk management policy, approved by the Board of Directors, to identify, evaluate and mitigate
business risks and protect stakeholder interests.
Set forth below are some of the risks that may potentially have an adverse impact on business, financial results, and performance
outlook, along with the initiatives taken by IndiGo to mitigate their impact.
•	Operational issues with aircraft
engines: IndiGo has been
experiencing supply-chain issues
related to the availability of spare
engines for its NEO aircraft, which
has impacted its operations.
Failure to obtain timely deliveries
of essential aircraft parts, such
as spare engines, can materially
impact its financials.
	IndiGo is working closely with
airframe and engine manufacturers
to ensure there is minimum
economic and operational impact.
Additionally, to meet the interim

38

operational challenges, IndiGo has
taken various measures such as
lease extension of aircraft due to
be redelivered, deferring phasing
out of CEOs, getting aircraft on
ACMI, etc. to reduce operational
disruptions.
•

Competition in the airline industry:

	The airline industry is highly
competitive. IndiGo faces
competition from other low-cost
carriers, as well as full-service
carriers that operate on similar
routes.

	To remain competitive, IndiGo
continually focuses on cost
leadership, industry-leading customer
service and on-time performance. In
addition, IndiGo continues to work
on launching new markets and flights
which enhance connectivity across the
network. IndiGo also optimises its
schedule to maximise the utilisation
of its assets.
	IndiGo’s codeshare partnership
with leading global airlines gives
the customers added flexibility
and comfort and helps to extend
reach beyond its directly served

Corporate Overview

destinations. Additionally, a digital
transformation journey is underway in
IndiGo including personalising digital
experience for customers, adding
AI driven capabilities and adopting
world class digital platforms. Further,
IndiGo is in the process of launching a
customer loyalty programme.
•	Pandemic risk:
	An outbreak of a communicable
disease (as with the recently
witnessed Covid-19, pandemic)
across the globe causes air travel
to inevitably become the subject
of governmental or regulatory
restrictions and limitations, due to
the potential adverse impact on
infection rates caused by unrestricted
movement of people. Global and
national efforts to limit the spread of
any pandemic can result in cessation
or disrupted operations, which can
potentially lead to erosion of IndiGo’s
reputation and decrease in demand
for travel. The adverse impact of
Covid-19, or possible outbreaks
of any other pandemic or similar
public health threat in the future can
significantly affect operations and
result in financial losses.
	IndiGo is committed to ensure safety
of its customers and employees
at the forefront. During Covid-19,
IndiGo acted in accordance with
applicable national and international
guidelines and regulations (including
implementing Covid-19 behaviour
protocols such as wearing of face
masks, PPE kits for customers,
employees including crew, as
applicable) in order to ensure
the safety of its customers and
employees. It follows well-established
SOPs and has robust systems to
deal with any unforeseen outbreak.
IndiGo’s strong focus on cost-control,
maintaining a large, modern and
efficient fleet, and its wide network
allow the airline to weather such
unexpected calamities better than
most competitors.
•

Exceptional variation in fuel prices:
Aircraft fuel expenses are the most
significant expense of IndiGo’s total

cost. The price of fuel can vary due
to numerous economic and political
factors and events that govern
them. IndiGo’s operating results are
negatively impacted by any adverse
movement in fuel prices.
Almost 80% of IndiGo’s fleet
comprises NEOs which are c.15%
more fuel efficient compared to the
A320 CEOs. IndiGo maintains a
young fleet resulting in lower fuel
consumption. Additionally, higher
seats in NEO family aircraft help in
reducing fuel CASK.
Further, IndiGo focuses on improving
fuel efficiency of its fleet to bring down
the operating costs. The Company also
adopts various fuel-efficient practices
such as single engine taxi and
optimising flight path.
•	Adverse movement in foreign
exchange:
	IndiGo’s costs including aircraft and
engine lease rentals, aircraft and
engine maintenance, and aircraft
insurance are denominated in foreign
currency. Adverse movement in foreign
exchange may impact profitability.

The currency movement and its
impact on the profitability is regularly
monitored. Further, IndiGo is focused
on enhancing its international
operations along-with adding
global strategic partnerships. This
will enable it to increase revenue
in foreign exchange that will offset
its currency exposure. Also, the
foreign exchange liability, owing
to supplementary rental liability,
is partially hedged by deposits
maintained in foreign currency.
•	Environmental, social and
governance risk:
As the focus of government and
regulatory organisations on
environmental impact of air travel
has increased, there are risks of
higher costs levied on the industry
to offset its carbon footprint. Beyond
carbon emission, other sustainability
efforts such as noise mitigation
and waste management have been
gaining increased focus from various
stakeholders. As more institutional
investors are considering ESG as
a factor when making investment

39

InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Annual Report 2022-23

decisions, this could result in lower
investment appetite in the aviation
sector in general.
The Board and the Management of
	
the Company have embraced ESG
as a strategic priority. ESG is being
integrated formally in each of the
functional aspects of the operations.
IndiGo has made pioneering efforts by
being one of the first airlines in the world
to invest in latest technology aircraft
NEOs which are c.15% more fuel efficient
than the old generation aircraft. IndiGo
also operates a very young fleet with
average fleet age around 3.5 years. As a
result, the carbon and noise footprint are
among the lowest in the world.

•	Inability to recruit and retain
key talent:

employee morale and honour the
most valued employees.

	IndiGo’s business requires it
to attract and retain highly
skilled, dedicated, and efficient
management personnel and other
critical employees. Any shortfall in
the availability or inability to hire,
train or retain qualified employees
may have an adverse impact on
operations and growth plan.

IndiGo is also taking several
initiatives to ensure physical and
mental well-being of its employees
with the launch of IndiGood Life.
IndiGo believes that an organisation
that listens to and cares for its
employees will benefit from an
empowered and motivated workforce.

To maximise talent retention, IndiGo
has a progressive Human Resource
policy and a succession plan in place
for crucial leadership positions.
Additionally, to ensure there is no
shortfall of crew, the Company has
developed a manpower planning
process which is complemented by
IndiGo’s recruitment and training
teams.

IndiGo is an equal opportunity
employer, and its gender mix compares
with global peers. Taking a lead in
efforts towards ensuring a gender
neutral workplace, it has the largest
number of women pilots globally.
The Company’s unparalleled network
provides connectivity to multiple
regional cities. IndiGo connected 56
city pairs and flew more than 8 lakhs
passengers last year under UDAN
scheme in FY 2023. This effort to link
remote stations via air connectivity
serves a national and societal need.
IndiGoReach, is the CSR arm of the
Company through which programmes
are implemented to contribute
towards the objective of sustainable
development for communities. IndiGo’s
CSR strategy has four focus areas which
covers children and education, women
empowerment, environment- friendly
initiatives, and heritage. Further, various
governance measures are in place in
IndiGo, which are being continually
monitored and improved upon.
IndiGo is also guided by a roadmap
for ESG, beginning with an industryrelevant ESG report, published
alongside this annual report, which
catalogues a wide range of initiatives
across the three dimensions of ESG.
IndiGo’s management and Board are
firmly convinced that its ESG efforts
will deliver a strategic advantage,
whereby all stakeholders will come
to perceive IndiGo as a responsible
airline of our times.

40

•

	Incident or accident leading to
personal injury and/or loss of life,
damage to aircraft, increasing cost
due to global aviation incidents can
affect the Company negatively.
Safety management is a key
priority at all levels at IndiGo. The
Company has a well-defined safety
management system which is based
on a strong safety policy, safety
risk management, safety assurance
processes and safety promotion.

For critical functions like Engineering
and Flight Operations, IndiGo has
in place trainee programmes that
continue to hone the skills of our
employees. IndiGo’s state-of-the art
learning academy, ifly, continues
to be at the forefront of training to
deliver an aviation-ready workforce.
These initiatives, backed by the fastgrowing population of job seekers
in India, will allow IndiGo to access
and develop the talent pool for its
operations.
•

IndiGo tracks a monthly report on
major flight operations and other
operational performance and incident
trends, as well as other multiple
Safety Performance Indicators on a
regular basis. It also conducts safety
audits regularly. Additionally, IndiGo
is a member of IATA Incident Data
Exchange Programme, to ensure its
safety performance is at par with, or
ahead of, global peers. In summary,
a modern fleet, operated by welltrained professionals and governed
by technology-enabled operations
will contribute to improved safety
performance.

Employee related risks:

	Labour actions and strikes can
cause disruption to operations and
profitability. This may also lead
to negative impact on employee
relations and morale.
IndiGo engages in multiple
programmes to develop talent and
builds employee connect through a
structured process including surveys.
With ‘6e Speaks’ — a quarterly pulse
feedback programme — IndiGo
aims to get inputs and feedback on
engagement levels of its employees
and based on the insights from
the survey, consistent actions are
taken to mitigate this risk. Further,
it has implemented rewards and
recognition programmes to boost

Airline safety:

•

Airline security:

	IndiGo’s response/ preparedness
for aircraft hijacks, as well as insider
threats, such as exploitation,
tampering, fraud, espionage, theft,
and sabotage due to malicious
intention (internal/ external).
As a security measure, IndiGo does
thorough background checks of all
employees who have access to
restricted areas. The Company has a
Vigilance Team at all major stations
to prevent theft, fraud, and malicious

Corporate Overview

intent which conducts spot-and- top
checks, including random screening
of staff and surprise check of AEP
(Airside Entry Permit). It conducts
periodic background verification
during the AEP renewal process.
It also has an approved security
programme which has SOP’s to
deal with hijack and other security
contingencies and works closely
with Civil Aviation Security (BCAS Regulator), Central Industrial Security
Force (CISF), and the police. IndiGo
also has a dedicated trained team
for ‘Emergency Response’, which is
adept to deal with any emergency
in accordance with laid down
procedures.
•

•	Changes in the Government
regulations:
	The Civil Aviation industry in India
is regulated by the MoCA, including
BCAS, the Directorate General of
Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Airports
Authority of India (AAI), and the
Airports Economic Regulatory
Authority (AERA) of India. The
regulations are extensive, complex
and cover all major aspects of
airline business and operations,
including training, licenses, aircraft
acquisitions, routing and passenger
facilitation and so on. Any changes in
such regulations, or the imposition of
additional restrictions and conditions,
can affect business and operations.

Breaches in IT/ Cybersecurity:
Airlines are heavily dependent
on IT and complex network
technology. These complex systems
and technologies are subject to
interruptions and delays caused
by catastrophic events, acts of war
or terrorism, power loss, computer
and telecommunications failures,
cyberattacks and security breaches
and similar events or disruptions.
Any such system interruptions or
security breaches may disrupt normal
business operations, potentially
leading to loss of business,
subjecting us to data breach, and
can result in multi-pronged impact
including regulatory actions,
operational interruption, reputation
loss, intellectual property loss and
so on.

	IndiGo takes the cybersecurity threat
diligently. Its cybersecurity structure
is aligned with industry standards
such as National Institute of
Standards and Technology and ISO/
IEC 27001. It follows the ‘Defence
in Depth’ approach to cybersecurity
and has implemented controls
for prevention, detection, and
response to cyberattacks. IndiGo is
continuously updating its technology
and improving its processes and
protocols to maintain and evolve its
cybersecurity framework.

IndiGo keeps itself abreast of all
regulatory changes and ensures
timely compliance, as amended
from time to time. The Company
maintains close communication
with the regulatory authorities and
airports to provide its customers a
safe, seamless, timely and affordable
domestic and international air
travel. IndiGo is a member of the
Federation of Indian Airlines which
works as an industry forum for voicing
and submitting concerns/response
of its airline members in policy and
regulatory matters relating to the
Aviation industry.
•

Reputation risk:

	IndiGo is exposed to reputation
damage if any of its aircraft is subject
to an emergency, accident, terrorist
incident or any other disaster. Further,
any adverse experience or harm
arising to customers or vendors, can
also potentially lead to damage to
IndiGo’s reputation.
	To effectively manage any adverse
event, IndiGo has a detailed crisis
response mechanism which clearly
outlines the flow of communication
and protocols. IndiGo also has a
dedicated emergency response team,
and processes and procedures in
place to immediately handle such
events.

Human resources
As a purposeful organisation, IndiGo
truly believes in the value of having
motivated people to deliver superior
customer satisfaction. The process starts
at recruitment where IndiGo seeks to
attract diverse and highly motivated
aspirants through a structured process.
The recruitment team evaluates the
knowledge, skills, and abilities of the
candidates and conducts aptitude,
language, and psychometric tests.
The Company constantly reviews its
business priorities and supports the
workforce with the required skills,
knowledge, mindset, and tools to
stay ahead in meeting customer
expectations. It continues to execute
learning through digital platforms,
classroom sessions and practical
orientation at the airports and on the
aircraft.
IndiGo’s learning academy ‘ifly’ is
entrusted with creating the IndiGo spirit,
enriching IndiGo culture and training
employees on business priorities
and future leadership behaviour. For
example, programmes such as ‘Career
Buddies’ support aspiring employees
in making the right career decisions
within the organisation, creating a
culture of growth. ‘Leadership Runway’,
a professional skill development
programme for senior cabin crew, equips
them with highly transferable skills for
future roles within the organisation.
Beyond these, ifly continues to develop
hundreds of cabin crew via new
employee training, as well as refreshers
on an ongoing basis.
IndiGo has several programmes aimed
at developing pilots from within the
organisation and from its employees’
families. ‘6e Family Fly’, is a programme
aimed at supporting members of its
employees’ families to be pilots, and
‘6e Fly High’ is aimed at supporting its
own employees desirous of becoming
pilots. With its steady induction of
graduating ‘Cadet Pilots’ and continuous
programme of internal promotions to
Captain positions, IndiGo believes that
it has a robust practice of developing
pilot talent, something that is key to the
Company’s future.

41

InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Annual Report 2022-23

With the changing environment, IndiGo
draws inputs from ‘6ESpeaks’- the
employee engagement survey, on an
annual and quarterly basis and devises
action plans based on these inputs.
IndiGo continues to promote diversity
and inclusion in the workplace. For
this, we create learning programmes
and awareness campaigns to help
employees understand the qualities of
inclusive leaders and recognise biases
that take place in critical processes
like hiring and career progression.
Also, we demonstrate the appropriate
way to deal with people of different
backgrounds. IndiGo has 269 women
in people management roles and 643
women pilots as of March 31, 2023,
making it the airline with the most
female pilots in the world. As a part
of IndiGo’ inclusivity agenda, it has
launched IndiGo take Off 2.0 that
invites and encourages women who
have taken career breaks to return to
work. In addition, it also has about 86
employees with disabilities. IndiGo
hopes to onboard 100 more people with
disabilities in FY 2024.

IndiGo’s commitment to a high trust, high
performance culture has been reinforced
with IndiGo being certified as a ‘Great
Place to Work’ by the Great Places to
Work Institute for three years in a row,
since IndiGo restarted participation in
CY 2021. This further strengthens its
position as one of the best workplaces in
India, offering a safe and inclusive work
environment.

IndiGo has recently launched 6E Breez
— the revamped intranet platform which
allows employees to stay abreast with the
latest Company updates, get access to
special discounts, offers and experiences.
A common platform for information related
to IndiGo employees.
As of March 31, 2023, IndiGo employed a
dynamic set of 32,407 employees, which
included 4,407 pilots and 8,567 cabin crew.

Internal control systems and their adequacy
IndiGo has put in place adequate internal control systems commensurate with its size
of operations. IndiGo’s internal control procedures are frequently reviewed and updated
to ensure compliance with various policies, practices, and statutes in keeping with the
organisation’s pace of growth and increasing complexity of operations. IndiGo maintains
a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
following:
Timely preparation
of reliable financial
information

Effectiveness
and efficiency of
operations

Adequacy of
safeguards for
assets

Accuracy and
completeness of the
accounting records

42

Prevention and
detection of
frauds and errors

An independent internal audit (employing
globally acclaimed firm) is carried out
to ensure the adequacy of the internal
control system and adherence to policies
and practices. The scope of the internal
audit activity is guided by the annual
audit plan, which is approved by the
Audit Committee of the Board. The Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors
regularly reviews the reports submitted
by the independent internal auditor
and the adequacy and effectiveness of
internal controls.

IndiGo takes a digital flight
The digital transformation journey is well
underway at IndiGo. A massive project
portfolio of digital projects is currently
at various stages of execution, aimed
at rapidly digitising IndiGo’s end-to-end
business processes, with state-of-theart architecture and technology. World
class, cloud native and industry standard
platforms are being deployed to digitise
core airlines processes and programmes
such as Hire to Retire, Airport workforce

Pay, Electronic Flight Briefing for flight
crew, Customer Relationship Management,
Training Management, Interlining,
Codeshare and several other. This will
ensure IndiGo has a solid, future ready,
digital foundation at the core.
The complete overhaul and re-write of
IndiGo’s direct channels (Website and

Mobile) is nearing closure. This will enable
IndiGo to rapidly respond to customer
needs, personalise the digital experience
and power an experimentation capability
that allows sensing customer preferences
and real-time feeding them into product
development pathways. Our goal of
delivering our customers a hassle-free and
delightful experience will be bolstered
with these new digital initiatives.
6E Breez, IndiGo’s digital employee
experience platform has been launched,
not only providing 1-click employee
services but also curated e-commerce
deals, exclusively for IndiGo’s staff. An
Enterprise Data Hub programme has been
launched to build IndiGo’s data, analytical
and AI capability, establish data as an
enterprise asset, deliver business insights
and analytics at speed, and enable

AI driven differentiating competitive
capabilities. IndiGo’s marketing has
adopted a ‘digital first’ strategy and
approach. Innovative marketing assets
such as 6E Tours, Made in IndiGo, Love
You Too and others, help build a strong
engagement and emotional bond with
IndiGo customers. Apart from this,
foundational work has commenced for
IndiGo’s loyalty programme, experimenting
with new digital business models as
well as engaging with the tech start-up
ecosystem.
IndiGo’s digital flight had a robust lift off
this year and is now surging ahead at
Mach speed.

4. Operational Performance
A. Operations and growth
IndiGo operated 1,815 (1,796 Scheduled, 18 Military, 1 Pax Charter) peak daily flights and carried over 85.59 million passengers during
FY 2023 compared to 1,574 peak daily flights and 49.80 million passengers in FY 2022. Passenger Load Factor increased from 73.6% in
FY 2022 to 82.1% in FY 2023. Total flights operated increased from 402,353 in FY 2022 to 597,829 in FY 2023.
IndiGo operated:
•

Scheduled services to 104* destinations, including 7 new destinations

•

456 cargo flights

•

2,854 charter flights (2,681 Military Charter and 173 Pax Charter)

*Operations to 4 destinations are yet to resume (CAN, CTU, HKG and RGN)

B. Inducting aircraft and procedures to save fuel
Our fleet, as on March 31, 2023, consists of 162 Airbus 320 NEO, 79 Airbus 321 NEO, 21 Airbus CEO, 39 ATR aircraft, 2 A321 Freighters
(P2F) and 1 B777 (damp lease). During FY 2023, we inducted 47 new fuel-efficient Airbus NEO powered by CFM LEAP-1A engines, 4
ATR Aircraft, 2 P2F and 1 B777.
IndiGo ranked No.1 for On-Time Performance (OTP) of 86.8% for FY 2023 on DGCA metros. IndiGo also achieved technical dispatch
reliability of 99.9%, as published by Airbus for FY 2023.
The Air Operating Certificate of the Company, which was due for renewal in August 2022, has been renewed for another five years
(i.e. up to August 2027). IndiGo has obtained Extended Diversion Time Operations (EDTO) for 120 minutes from the Director General
of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to fly on direct routes oversea for 120 minutes on A320 family aircraft. This would help in achieving shorter
routes and result in fuel saving.

C. Operational initiatives
We established yet another industry benchmark with a new initiative on enhancing customer experience introduced on our
16th Anniversary. This was a third ramp to disembark passengers on arrival in order to reduce the disembarkation time and IndiGo is
the first carrier in the world to introduce this service. This initiative saves an average of 3 minutes per flight and in turn improves the
turnaround time for the aircraft. The implementation has helped us save 6.75 hours every day which can go towards more efficient
aircraft utilisation.
IndiGo was the first organisation within India to receive DGCA approval for initial and recurrent training for the implementation of
Competency Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) and Evidence Based Training (EBT). CBTA uses scenario-based training for more
realism and facilitation techniques by the instructor to support the pilot’s development and enhances the pilot’s competence to
demonstrate the right skills. This was implemented in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and International Air
Transport Association (IATA) standards to develop resilience amongst the pilots, which was required to tide over the last two years.
This reaffirms our commitment towards the adoption of industry-leading initiatives to enhance safety and our training standard.
IndiGo is the first airline to get regulatory approval and successfully completed a Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV)
approach on ATR using the indigenous GAGAN Satellite to land at airports with no navigational infrastructure.
The Company continues its digitalisation journey with the aim of enhancing operational efficiency. IndiGo becomes the first organisation
to Go-Live with the Direct and Automatic Data Transfer of flying hours from our crewing systems to the eGCA Pilot Logbook Portal. With
this initiative, our pilots no longer need to maintain and carry physical logbooks. We are also in the process of attaining DGCA approval
and launching the ‘AvioBook’ Electronic Flight Folder – an integrated digital solution to optimise the entire flight operation, enhancing
safety and improving decision-making and operational efficiency, along with reducing the weight onboard.
We continue to take additional measures to enhance fuel efficiency by inducting Fuel Monitoring and Management Software and
improving current measures such as Fuel tankering, straightening of routes, onboard weight reduction, and pilot awareness.

of fungible leaders who can assume new roles in any work context.

21.Whistle blower Policy / Vigil Mechanism
The Company believes that it is critical to listen to whistle blowers to take the path to sustainable growth and good governance.
Any actual or potential violation of the Code of Conduct, or any law governing IndiGo, howsoever insignificant, is a matter of serious
concern. Timely reporting of such violations could avoid or minimise the Company’s reputational or financial losses. To this effect, and
pursuant to Section 177(9) of the Act and Regulation 22 of the SEBI LODR Regulations, a robust whistle blower/ vigil mechanism has
been laid down, which enables timely and reliable reporting of actual or suspected violations.
As part of this, the Company has laid down a Whistle blower Policy, which provides the procedures for employees and other
stakeholders to report unacceptable practices, misconduct, or violation of its Code of Conduct or applicable laws, provides necessary
safeguards to protect whistle blowers from victimization and retaliation, and provides for direct access to the Chairperson of the Audit
Committee, in exceptional circumstances. During FY 2023, no person was denied access to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee.
The policy is available on the Investor Relations section of IndiGo’s website https://www.goindigo.in/content/dam/goindigo/investorrelations/policies/IGAL-WhistleBlower-Policy-clean-11-17-22.pdf.
The whistleblowing mechanism also comprises a whistle blower helpline, named as “6E Ethics Helpline”. This provides whistle blowers
five channels to report violations, including toll-free hotline, email, web portal, chatbot and postal mail. Four of these reporting
channels provide whistle blowers the choice to report anonymously. The Company takes pride in successfully implementing its whistle
blowing helpline in ways that have instilled confidence amongst employees and other stakeholders to raise their concerns.
All complaints of suspected violations are taken seriously and reviewed promptly. All investigations are carried out objectively and
independently, following the principles of natural justice. Based on the nature and severity of the violation of the Code of Conduct,
the Company policies and/or the law, appropriate action is taken. The Audit Committee oversees the implementation of the Policy and
reviews the resolution of complaints on a quarterly basis.

entails IndiGo’s continuous commitment towards conservation of energy and motivates it to embrace newer technological advances.
The Company has incorporated policies, including flight and ground procedures, for conservation of fuel and has trained flight crew
and aircraft maintenance engineers to ensure that fuel is conserved to the extent possible.
The Company ensures that there is adequate fuel for its aircraft, after evaluating various traffic trends in the air and also on the
ground, thus avoiding any additional/ unnecessary fuel upliftment. The Company has installed softwares for accurate flight planning.
These softwares provide accurate maps and the most efficient flight path, employing continuous descent approaches and economy
cruise speeds. It also provides recommendations for optimising engine settings for take-off and climb. Further, innovative statistical
data driven solutions has been adopted along with recommended manufacturer upgrades for descent fuel optimisation. We are also
working with Airbus on big data analytics using Airbus platforms like SKYWISE.
The Company has also adopted fuel policies designed to reduce costs on the ground, including the use of the Eco-Power Engine Wash
process for aircraft engines, the use of ground equipment in place of aircraft auxiliary power units (which consume more fuel), use
of single engine for taxiing on ground and introduction of other engineering/operating protocols. These policies are all designed to
optimise fuel consumption and reduce our carbon footprint and thereby finally reducing costs.
We continue to use technology to enhance processes to ensure safe and comfortable travel by air which helped gain customer
confidence in IndiGo. Innovation such as solar Baggage Freight Loader (BLF) and Combo unit [combined Ground Power Unit (GPU) and
Aircraft Cooling Unit (ACU)], helped in saving ATF, reducing carbon emissions. We are investing in Combo units which reduce Auxiliary
Power Unit (APU) usage on ground and helped in reducing APU fuel burn and reducing carbon footprint.
We are engaged with stakeholders to collaborate on multiple air space optimisation initiatives like shortening of routes, promulgation
of required navigation performance (RNP) approaches, optimising flight routes through conditional route (CDR). We are the first
operator to adopt LPV (localiser performance with vertical guidance) approaches on ATR Fleet. This shall enable our ATR aircraft to
land under marginal weather conditions utilising indigenous satellite-based augmentation system GAGAN. The Government of India
has promoted flexible use of airspace and we are using this opportunity to utilise every bit of airspace to reduce fuel consumption
and simultaneously reducing carbon footprint.
Further, operational endeavours have helped save carbon emissions to the tune of approximately 37000 tonnes through single engine
taxiing, optimized landing and focused fuel uplift.
The Company has sought to reduce the weight of its aircraft by selecting lighter seats and by choosing not to have in- flight
entertainment systems. The aircraft weight has been further reduced by equipping the entire fleet with Electronic Flight Bags (EFB)
and removing paper manuals weighing 40kg from each Airbus aircraft. As an example, this small initiative alone will save the Company
fuel to the tune of 800 tonnes each year and 2,500 tonnes of carbon emissions approximately.
We continue to explore the feasibility of using ground vehicles on cleaner alternative fuels like CNG/ electricity to reduce carbon
emissions at airports.

Board Meetings and Procedure:
The Board and committee meetings are pre-scheduled, and an annual calendar of such meetings is decided and informed to all the
Directors in advance. In exceptional circumstances and on matters requiring immediate action, the meetings are either held at shorter
notice, with necessary approval in compliance with applicable provisions, or the approval of such matter(s) is taken by passing
resolution(s) through circulation, subject to complying with all regulatory requirements.
The Board meets at regular intervals to discuss and decide on the Company’s business policy and strategies apart from other normal
business activities. The maximum interval between any two meetings of the Board/committee did not exceed 120 days during the
year. Agenda papers containing all necessary information/documents are made available to the Board / committee members in
advance to enable them to discharge their responsibilities effectively and take informed decisions. All necessary information as
specified in the Act, Secretarial Standard -1, and the SEBI LODR Regulations, is regularly made available to the Board.
The Company Secretary finalises the agenda for the Board meetings in consultation with the Chairman, the CEO and the Managing
Director. The agenda for committee meetings is circulated after consultation with the Chairpersons of the respective committees. The
relevant members of the Management team are invited for discussions on the Company’s performance at these meetings. In special
and exceptional circumstances, additional item(s) are taken up as ‘any other item’ with the permission of the Chairperson of the Board
/ respective committee and with the consent of majority of the Board / committee members present at the meeting.

Board Support:
The Company Secretary is responsible for convening of the Board and committee meetings along with preparation of the agenda
papers for such meetings. The Company Secretary attends all the meetings of the Board and its committees and ensures that the
Board and its committees, function in accordance with compliance and governance principles. The Company Secretary also ensures
appropriate recording of minutes of the meetings after incorporating the comments received from the members of the Board or
respective committees on the draft minutes within the timeline as specified in the Act.
In compliance of the provisions of the Act, the Company Secretary annually obtains from each Director, details of the Board and Board’s
committees positions he/ she occupies in other companies, and changes, if any, regarding their directorships and places the same at
the subsequent Board meetings.

Post-Meeting Follow-up System:
We have an effective post-meeting follow-up system, whereby all-important decisions taken at Board/committee meetings are tracked
until their closure.

Independent Directors:
Pursuant to Regulation 25(8) of the SEBI LODR Regulations, the Independent Directors have confirmed that they are not aware of any
circumstances or situation which exist, or which may be reasonably anticipated, that could impact their ability to discharge their duties
with an objective independent judgment and without any external influence. As confirmed to the Board, the Independent Directors
meet the criteria of independence and are independent of the Management, as mentioned under Regulation 16(1)(b) of the SEBI
LODR Regulations.
Ms. Pallavi Shardul Shroff, Independent Director of the Company, is the Managing Partner of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.,
Solicitors & Advocates, which is one of the legal firms from which the Company avails professional services. The Company has paid
Rs. 2.43 million during FY 2023 to such firm for availing the professional services. The Board has determined that such payment in the
context of gross turnover of such legal firm or total income of the Company is negligible and does not affect independence of Ms. Shroff.

xvi. Credit Ratings
On March 20, 2023, ICRA revised the outlook for the Company to stable from negative and reaffirmed the Company’s short-term
rating at [ICRA]A1 and long term rating at [ICRA]A. ICRA reported that change in outlook is on account of improvement in operating
environment for the airline industry, aided by a healthy improvement in passenger volumes and moderation in Aviation Turbine Fuel
(ATF) prices over past few months. Expectation of sustained healthy passenger volumes coupled with relatively stable operating
environment provides comfort and raises optimism for the Company going forward.
The ratings continue to factor in Company’s domestic market leadership position, large scale, extensive network, and sustained cost
competitive positioning, which are expected to help it generate improved cash flows going forward. The ratings also take in account
the Company’s strong liquidity position, with sizeable free cash balances and access to undrawn lines of credit, which provides it
healthy flexibility to absorb any unforeseen weakening in industry conditions.
ICRA has highlighted challenges of volatility in fuel and foreign exchange, rising competition within industry and increase in the
Company’s overall debt. However, ICRA also acknowledged that sector was able to pass on the cost to certain extent by increase in
yields without impacting demand. Further ICRA has noted improvement in leverage ratios of the Company.
The above rating action was intimated to stock exchanges under provisions of Regulation 30 of the SEBI LODR Regulations.

Commodity risks faced by the Company during the year and how they have been managed:
The Company has a significant exposure to jet fuel prices and closely monitors the jet fuel prices and their impact on yourthe
Company’s profitability. We believe that an increase in input costs needs to be recovered in the form of higher fares and hence,
we do not use financial instruments for hedging the exposure. However, we have taken a number of steps to reduce our fuel
consumption which ultimately led to lower unit fuel costs.

IX. Auditor’s Certificate on Corporate Governance
The Company has complied with all the requirements of corporate governance as specified in the SEBI LODR Regulations during

Corporate Overview

Statutory Reports

Financial Statements

About the report
The top 1000 listed entities in India,
based on market capitalization, are
required to include the Business
Responsibility & Sustainability Report
(BRSR) in their annual reports. The BRSR
draws on the nine principles covered
under the National Guidelines on
Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC)
and Business Responsibility Report
(BRR) by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
(MCA). "A single comprehensive source of
non-financial sustainability information
relevant to all business stakeholders—
investors, shareholders, regulators, and

the general public," is how the MCA
characterizes the BRSR.
As part of the top 1000 listed companies
in India, this requirement is applicable
to InterGlobe Aviation Limited, hereafter
referred to as “We”, “IndiGo” or “the
Company” from FY 2023. In full compliance
with the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (SEBI
LODR Regulations), IndiGo has developed
its second BRSR for FY 2023. The Company
voluntarily published its first BRSR last year

(for FY 2022). With the BRSR, we take the
opportunity to apprise our stakeholders,
of the Company's responsible business
initiatives, along with the Company's
approach to building long-term value.
We are aware that IndiGo’s responsible
business conduct extends beyond reporting
and must be supported by the Company
taking the necessary steps to ensure
sustainability in the right spirit and continue
to take measures actively in this direction.

InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Annual Report 2022-23

Executive Summary
InterGlobe Aviation Limited is a leading air transportation company in India. As of March 2023, we had 304
aircraft in our fleet. With a presence in 78 domestic and 261 international cities, we served around 86 million
passengers in FY 2023.
Our network not only serves needs of people living in metros, but also serves the needs of people living in remote
parts of the country. We take pride in being a part of the Government of India’s “UDAN” scheme which is focused
on providing flying opportunities to common people of the country. These efforts also help in generation of direct
and indirect employment in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in India. Our ambition is well formulated in our purpose of
‘Giving wings to the nation, by connecting people and aspirations’.
Aviation industry contributes slightly over 2% of overall global CO2 emissions. As an airline, we are aware of our
environment related responsibilities and are taking steps to mitigate climate related risks. Since 2011, we have
made our aircraft investments in latest generation Airbus A320 NEO aircraft which are 15% more fuel efficient,
compared to the earlier generation aircraft. With our investments in the new generation aircraft, we have been
able to reduce CO2 footprint by around 20% since FY 2016. These aircraft also have a lower noise footprint. In
addition, we are making investments in electrification of our ground equipment and usage of renewable energy
wherever an opportunity exits.
We have made efforts in elimination of waste in a responsible manner and have made significant replacements
of single use plastic items in our flights with biodegradable and eco-friendly options.
Since IndiGo’s inception, we have taken initiatives towards creation of a social and inclusive work culture, where
people are valued for their talent, skill and performance. We follow workplace policies which stimulate gender
diversity and provide inclusivity to people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ community. This report
also details out our approach to creating social impact and achieving a transparent organization on a foundation
of strong governance. We hope that the report will be helpful in furthering the understanding of our ESG approach
and initiatives that we undertake with the support of all our stakeholders.

Climate change

Risk

Climate is an
important part of
our environmental
responsibility. We are
committed to reduce our
carbon footprint. Some
of the key climate risks
that we foresee are:
• Policy and legal
risk from emerging
regulatory changes
e.g., CORSIA
• Increased fuel cost
e.g., SAF
• Reduced
demand due to
stigmatization of
sector

In case of risk, approach to
adapt or Mitigate

Financial implications of
the risk or opportunity
(Indicate positive or
Negative implications)

•

We are closely
monitoring
the regulatory
developments, so that
we can better respond
to the requirements.
Our investments in
fuel efficient aircraft
will help us to reduce
our carbon offset
requirements under
CORSIA
Sustainable aviation
fuel is one of the
proposed solutions
towards mitigating
CO2 emissions, we are
working with regulators
and oil marketing
companies to identify
cost effective solutions
Communication with
customers on IndiGo’s
low carbon footprint
shall help IndiGo to
position itself as a
greener airline option
compared to other
airlines

•

IndiGo’s fleet strategy
has three key featuresi. Investments in fuel
efficient aircraft, A320
NEO aircraft are 15%
fuel efficient compared
to old generation
aircraft
ii. Young fleet- IndiGo
maintains a young
aircraft fleet, currently
the average fleet age
is 3.5 years
• Light weight aircraft
• Our flight operations
Standard operating
procedures “SOP’s” are
designed to optimize
fuel cost
• Usage of Ground
Power Units and Air
Conditioning Units
instead of Auxiliary
power units
• Deploy alternative
energy sources
wherever possible
• Utilize energy efficient
practices in all
corporate offices and
airport

•

•

Fuel and energy
conservation

Opportunity

Fuel and energy
conservation is critical
to reduce our carbon
footprint and to reduce
our cost of operations.
Our strategies to
achieve these objectives
are:
• Fleet strategy
• Flight Operations
• Ground operations
• Sustainable office
spaces

•

•

•

•

•

•

Policy action in
recent years point
towards a stricter
regime, e.g., CORSIA
requirements require
airline companies to
offset carbon emissions
from international
operations, resulting
in higher cost of
operations
The cost of Sustainable
Aviation Fuel is
disproportionately
higher than the cost
of normal jet fuel. This
may result in a higher
cost of operations, in
the coming years
Increased focus on
climate related risks
globally may create a
sector perception risk
in the long term. Few
business customers
may potentially
adopt to substitution
methodologies, which
may have a bearing on
demand for air traffic
Fuel cost comprises
40-50% of the total
airline cost and 15%
improvement in fuel
consumption results in
significant cost savings
Younger aircraft are
relatively fuel efficient,
and result in lower cost
Low aircraft weight
results in lower fuel
burn, thereby resulting
in lower cost
Usage of Ground power
unit and ACUs help in
reducing the cost of
operations and have a
better carbon footprint

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets, and
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) Response:
At IndiGo, we take pride in our commitment to prioritize responsible business practices, ethical conduct and sustainability with
integration of Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects in our business operations. As we continue to mature on our
ESG journey, we continue to prioritize critical initiatives aimed at transforming our Company into an ESG thought leader within
the aviation sector both in India and globally. These efforts span the length and breadth of our organization from deploying one
of the most energy efficient fleets in the world, to implementing DEI programmes, and focusing on building the skills and capacity
of our employees among others.
As an aviation company, we recognize the vital importance of managing our carbon footprint effectively. Our fleet is comprised
primarily of Airbus A320 NEO family aircraft which are 15% more energy efficient than the older generation Airbus A320 CEO
family aircraft. Apart from this we have also implemented a slew of operational measures to conserve as much fuel as possible
during take-off, cruise and landing. Our ground operations team is also working towards gradually phasing out diesel operated
equipment and replace them with electric equipment where possible.
We continue to work with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Indian Institute of Petroleum (CSIR-IIP) in our aim to use
SAF in the future. We are working with relevant stakeholders to accelerate the viability of SAF in the aviation sector, since SAF
is critical in transition towards a low-carbon pathway. As a renewable and low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel that can
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, SAF represents the best option for airline companies to decarbonize in the short
to medium term while we await the eventual transition to hydrogen in the long-term. By using SAF, we can reduce upstream and
downstream greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This significant reduction in emissions can
contribute towards achieving our sustainability goals and mitigating our impact on the environment. However, global limited SAF
availability reduces our reach on this front.
Moreover, we are steadily making progress to manage plastic waste on our flights and are phasing out single-use plastic. We
also have innovative programs in place to recycle the seats and carpets in our aircraft into products like bags.
We are committed towards Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in workplace. With one of the highest number of women pilots among
global airlines, we have created an environment of inclusivity. We have policy and initiatives in place to increase the numbver of
women in management positions and joined IATA’s 25 by 2025 initiatives that focuses on increasing women leadership to 25%.
Additionally, we have taken steps to ensure that people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals feel supported and valued at
IndiGo. We believe in enabling a supportive culture which treats people equitably and celebrates differences.
We have also aligned our efforts with ensuring every Indian citizen has the accessibility to fly under the UDAN initiative launched
by the Government of India and the Civil Aviation Ministry of India. Under this scheme, IndiGo has flown over 8,00,000 passengers
in FY 2023. Furthermore, we are continuously expanding our network coverage to ensure that we cover more customers and are
on track to connect the states in the northeast, with the rest of India. In this past year, we have flown over 650 flights under the
UDAN scheme to ensure the common man has the same 6E experience which has been cherished by our customers over the span
of 16 years.
As a socially responsible organization, we understand that our efforts through our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
initiatives continue to positively impact the lives of many people. With our CSR arm, IndiGo Reach, we have supported over
40,000 students this year through our education programs, enabling them to achieve their dreams. More than 50,000 women
have been empowered through our livelihood enhancement programs, providing them with the necessary skills and resources
to take control of their futures. We have also rallied and joined hands with nearly 19,000 individuals who are committed to
conservation of the ecosystem, waste reduction, eco-restoration, and upcycling projects. Our local outreach efforts to societies
we serve include afforestation and tree plantation in certain rural areas to aid efforts to mitigate climate change. Furthermore,
we continue to focus our efforts on heritage restoration in collaboration with the Aga Khan Foundation.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics
(including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste:
Response: IndiGo believes in going beyond compliance and has taken numerous steps to improve waste management practices
across its operations. The maintenance of equipment such as equipment filters, batteries, plastic materials, rubber/metal components,
and tires generates waste that needs to be properly managed. At IndiGo, the crew is responsible for collecting, cataloguing, sorting,
and storing this debris in the scrapyard. To facilitate the disposal of garbage, our ground support staff classify it into seven different
categories, which include rubber, plastic, metal, batteries, tires, lubricants, and old flyers.
To ensure that waste is properly managed, we have implemented a set of steps for reusing, recycling, and disposing of waste. These
include:
a)

Segregating plastic waste and disposing it off with authorized vendors who are ISO certified.

b)

Disposing of batteries to authorized vendors once they reach the end of their life cycle.

c)

Regularly emptying ground equipment waste oils, such as engine oil/hydraulic oil, at specified intervals, such as hourly, calendar,
or by kilometre.

d)

Re-threading worn-out tires through three rounds before being discarded.

e)

Delivering scrap/waste oil to vendors under the supervision of IndiGo and the airport operators.

These measures reflect our commitment to environmental sustainability, and we take pride in managing waste in a responsible and
eco-friendly manner. As a result, we aim to minimize our environmental impact and contribute to a better and more sustainable future
for all stakeholders, including our valued investors.

10. Health and safety management system:
a.

Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the
coverage such system?

		Response: IndiGo believes that a safe and healthy work environment is a pre-requisite for employee well-being, and the
adoption of best practices in occupational health and safety have a direct impact on its overall performance. As mandated by
the Directorate General before Civil Aviation (DGCA) under the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), We have implemented an
occupational health and safety management system. Our SOPs are modified using Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) principles
based on current scientific data in the following areas:
		

•

Crew fatigue reporting

		

•

Systematic testing for alcohol

		

•

Psychoactive drug testing

		

•

Advisory for passengers

b.

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?

		Response: : IndiGo places great emphasis on safety management and has established various processes and technologies to
ensure the safety of its operations. The Company’s Safety Management System (SMS) is the foundation that enables IndiGo to
operate safely.
		

Integrum, a safety reporting application that allows employees to report possible hazards in the form of required and optional
reports. This technology is an essential part of IndiGo's Safety Management System (SMS) and Structured Safety Process (SSP)
frameworks, which include both proactive and reactive components.

		

The reactive component of IndiGo's SMS and SSP frameworks involves investigating accidents and incidents that occur within
the system. This investigation process is crucial because it identifies the underlying causes of accidents and incidents, provides
lessons learned, and contributes to the continual improvement of the aviation system. IndiGo has a sophisticated system in
place to collect all network incidents, which are then reported to regulatory authorities by the Flight Safety department as
needed.

Each occurrence is investigated in collaboration with stakeholders concerned, including flight operations, engineering, inflight
services, airport operations and customer services, OEMs, and airport operators to determine the root cause(s) and contributory
factor(s). Based on the findings, mitigation actions are formulated to prevent future occurrences. IndiGo's Permanent Investigation
Board, in collaboration with the regulatory authority, investigates all major events.

		

In summary, a continuous encouragement on safety culture has resulted in increase in safety awareness across the operational
staff, which is evident by the type and number of reports being received by Flight Safety. IndiGo's commitment to safety is
demonstrated by its Safety Management System and Structured Safety Process frameworks, and the use of technologies like
Integrum. Additionally, the thorough investigation of accidents and incidents and the formulation of mitigation actions to prevent
future occurrences are key elements of IndiGo's safety management approach.

c.

Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)

potential hazards, and to safeguard its personnel. A holistic approach is taken to address all health-related issues in the
workplace, with the aim of minimizing incidents.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of InterGlobe Aviation Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of InterGlobe Aviation Limited (“the Company”), which comprise
the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the
Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements,
including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a
true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at
March 31, 2023, its loss including other comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ‘Code of
Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the
responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report,
including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures
performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone financial statements.

transactions, and corresponding tax treatment, the Company has
considered the substance of the transaction rather than just the
legal form including among other factors, treatment of receipt of
non-refundable incentives in connection with acquisition of new
aircrafts.
We considered lease accounting, of aircraft and other leases
(including the corresponding tax treatment), as a key audit
matter due to significant judgement required in the assumptions
and estimates used to determine the Right of Use (ROU) asset
and lease liability, viz assessment of lease term (including
modification terms), determination of appropriate incremental
borrowing rate, treatment of non-refundable incentives received in
connection with the acquisition of the aircrafts and other assets in
ROU, componentisation of the ROU asset, and the tax treatment
of incentives involves a significant degree of management
judgement in interpreting the various relevant rules, regulations

respect of aircraft leased during the term of the lease.
• assessed the design, implementation and operating effectiveness
These arise from legal and contractual obligations relating to the
condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor.
At each reporting date, the calculation of the maintenance
provision includes a number of variable factors and assumptions
including: likely utilisation of the aircraft; the expected cost of the
heavy maintenance check at the future date it is expected to occur;
the condition of the aircraft engine, contractual return conditions.
Given the involvement of inherent level of management judgement
required as a result of the complex and subjective element around
these variable factors and assumptions in order to quantify the
provision amounts, we have identified this as a key audit matter.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the
Annual report, but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial
Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these
standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive
income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India,
including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with
the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Annual Report 2022-23

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We also:
•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether
the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd..)
Annexure 1 referred to in paragraph 1 under the heading “Report on Other Legal and Regulatory
Requirements” of our report of even date
Re: InterGlobe Aviation Limited (‘the Company’)
(i) (a) (A) The company has maintained proper records showing full particulars, including quantitative details and situation of Property,
Plant and Equipment.
		

(B) The company has maintained proper records showing full particulars of intangible assets.

(b) The Company has a regular programme of physical verification of its Property, Plant and Equipment by which all of them are
verified in a phased manner over a period of two years except for aircraft and spare engines, which are verified on an annual
basis and rotables which are verified in a phased manner over a period of three years. In our opinion, this periodicity of physical
verification by management is reasonable, having regard to the size of the Company and the nature of its assets. In accordance
with this programme, certain Property, Plant and Equipment were physically verified during the year. As informed to us, no
material discrepancies were noticed on such verification.
(c) There is no immovable property (other than properties where the Company is the lessee and the lease agreements are duly
executed in favour of the lessee), held by the Company and accordingly, the requirement to report on clause 3(i)(c) of the Order
is not applicable to the Company.
(d) The Company has not revalued its Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of use assets) or intangible assets during the
year ended March 31, 2023.
(e) There are no proceedings initiated or are pending against the Company for holding any benami property under the Prohibition of
Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 and rules made thereunder.
(ii) (a) The management has conducted physical verification of inventory at reasonable intervals except for inventories lying with third

of loans, stood guarantee or provided security to companies, firms, Limited Liability Partnerships or any other parties. Accordingly, the

Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd..)
Annexure 2 referred in Paragraph 2(F) under the heading “Report on Other Legal and Regulatory
Requirements” of our Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of InterGlobe Aviation Limited (“the
Company”) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended
on that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control
over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to standalone
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these
financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over
financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to these Financial Statements
A Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to these Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements to future
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to these financial statements may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at
March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

2.b Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to the periods presented in these standalone financial statements
except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change
in the accounting policy.

(i) Current - non-current classification
All assets and liabilities are classified into current and non-current.

Assets
An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:
•

it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company’s normal operating cycle;

•

it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;

•

it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or

•

it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after
the reporting period.

Current assets include the current portion of non-current assets. All other assets are classified as non-current.

Liabilities
A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:
•

it is expected to be settled in the Company’s normal operating cycle;

•

it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;

•

it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or

•

the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting
period. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments
do not affect its classification.

Current liabilities include the current portion of non-current liabilities. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

Operating cycle
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents.
Based on the nature of operations and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and
cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle being a period of 12 months for the purpose of classification of
assets and liabilities as current and non- current.

(ii) Foreign currency transactions and translations
Functional and presentation currency
The management has determined the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates i.e., functional currency,
to be Indian Rupees (Rs.). The standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, which is the Company’s functional and
presentation currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest millions upto two decimal places, unless otherwise stated.

Annual Report 2022-23

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)

Transactions and balances
Monetary and non-monetary transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the Company at the
exchange rates on the date of the transactions or at an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of
the transaction.
Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities remaining unsettled on reporting date are translated at the rates of exchange
prevailing on reporting date. Gains / (losses) arising on account of realisation/settlement of foreign exchange transactions and on
translation of monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. However,
gains / (losses) arising on translation of certain lease liabilities which represents long-term foreign currency monetary loans taken
before March 31, 2016 and used for acquisition of depreciable right of use assets, are adjusted in the cost of respective item of right
of use assets. The treatment will continue till the repayment of the long-term foreign currency monetary loans.
Foreign exchange gains / (losses) arising on translation of foreign currency monetary loans are presented in the Standalone Statement
of Profit and Loss on net basis. However, foreign exchange differences arising from foreign currency monetary loans to the extent
regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs are presented in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss, within finance costs.

(iii) Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset
or transfer the liability takes place either:
-

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

-

In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to / by the Company.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the standalone financial statements are categorised within
the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a
whole:
•

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

•

Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or
indirectly observable

Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the standalone financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature,
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, investments (other than investment in subsidiaries), at fair value at each
reporting date. Also, fair value of financial instruments measured at amortised cost is disclosed in Note 29.

(iv) Investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost, less any impairment in the value of investment, in these separate standalone financial
statements.

(v) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of
another entity.

Financial assets
Recognition and initial measurement
All financial assets are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All
financial assets, except trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, are initially measured at fair value
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction
price.
Classification and subsequent measurement
Classification
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, the Company classifies financial assets in following categories:
•

Financial assets at amortised cost

•

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

•

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset being ‘debt instrument’ is measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
•

The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and

•

The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are Solely Payments of Principal and
Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset being ‘debt instrument’ is measured at FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:
•

The asset is held within the business model, whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling
the financial assets, and

•

The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount
outstanding.

A financial asset being equity instrument is measured at FVTPL.
All financial assets, not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI as described above, are measured at FVTPL.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at amortised cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by
impairment losses, if any. Interest income and impairment are recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
Financial assets at FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest income, are recognised in the
Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
Financial assets at FVTOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Derecognition
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers
the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of
the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the Standalone
Statement of Profit and Loss.

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)
The Company recognises loss allowances using the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for the financial assets which are not fair valued
through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to
lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there
has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition, in which case those financial assets are measured at lifetime ECL.
The changes (incremental or reversal) in loss allowance computed using ECL model, are recognised as an impairment gain or loss in
the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
Write-off
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect
of recovery. This is generally the case when the Company determines that the counterparty does not have assets or sources of income
that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could
still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Company’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Financial liabilities
Recognition and initial measurement
All financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All
financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value minus, in the case of financial liabilities not recorded at fair value through profit
or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the liability.
Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial
recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are
recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
Financial liabilities other than classified as FVTPL, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest expense are recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in
the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
Derecognition
The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.
The Company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified terms are
substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference
between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognised
in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Standalone Balance Sheet when, and only
when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis
or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	Compound financial instruments - convertible preference shares
Compound financial instruments issued by the Company comprises of convertible preference shares that can be converted to equity
shares of the Company.
Convertible preference shares are bifurcated into liability and equity components based on the terms of the contract.
The liability component of convertible preference shares is initially recognised at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have
an equity conversion option. The equity component is initially recognised at the difference between the fair value of the compound
financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated
to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. The equity component of convertible preference shares is not remeasured subsequently.
Interest related to the liability component is recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. On conversion, the liability
component is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised.

(vi) Share capital
Equity share capital
Issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as equity share capital in equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of
new equity shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

(vii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises of cash at banks and on hand, cheques on hand and short-term deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

(viii) Property, plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if
any.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises: (a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; (b) any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate
component of property, plant and equipment. The Company has recognised major inspection costs relating to engine and airframe
overhauls and other heavy maintenance as separate components for owned aircraft, owned engines and leased aircraft previously
classified as finance leases under erstwhile Ind AS.
The cost of improvements to aircraft taken on lease except leased aircraft which were previously classified as finance leases under
erstwhile Ind AS, if recognition criteria are met, have been capitalised and disclosed separately as leasehold improvement - aircraft.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property, plant and equipment
(calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment) is
included in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss when property, plant and equipment is derecognised. The carrying amount of
any component accounted as a separate component is derecognised, when replaced or when the property, plant and equipment to
which the component relates gets derecognised.

Subsequent costs
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as separate assets, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that the future economic benefits associated with expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss at the time of incurrence.

Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values and is charged to
Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, except owned aircraft and spare engines,
rotables and non-aircraft equipment, leasehold improvements and leasehold improvements - aircraft, is provided on written down
value method at the rates and in the manner provided in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation on owned aircraft and
spare engines, rotables and non-aircraft equipment is provided on the straight line method at the rates and in the manner prescribed
in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
Major inspection costs relating to engine and airframe overhauls and other heavy maintenance are identified as separate components
for owned aircraft, owned engines and leased aircraft previously classified as finance leases under erstwhile Ind AS and are depreciated
over the expected lives between major overhauls and remaining useful life of the aircraft/engines, whichever is lower.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment has been charged based on the following useful lives:
Asset Head
Owned Aircraft and spare engines
-	Aircraft and engine components including spare engines
-	Major inspection and overhaul costs
Rotables and non-aircraft equipment*
Furniture and fixtures
Computer
-	End user devices
-	Server and networks
Office equipment
-	Office equipment

	* The life of the rotables is reassessed, the moment these are installed to the aircraft and are expected to be redelivered along with
the aircraft. Accordingly, the net carrying value of rotables are depreciated in the same period in which such aircraft is redelivered.
Expenditure incurred towards leasehold improvements - aircraft is depreciated on a straight line basis over the remaining period of the
lease of the aircraft or 5 years, whichever is lower.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight line basis over the period of the initial lease term or their estimated useful
life, whichever is lower.
Buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over the remaining period of the lease of land on which building is constructed or
60 years, whichever is lower.
The useful lives have been determined based on internal evaluation done by management and are in line with the estimated useful
lives, to the extent prescribed by the Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, in order to reflect the technological obsolescence and
actual usage of the asset. The residual values are not more than 5% of the original cost of the asset.
Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis for assets purchased/sold during the period.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed by management at each
reporting date and adjusted prospectively, as appropriate.

Capital work-in-progress
Property, plant and equipment not ready for use as at the reporting date are disclosed as capital work-in-progress. It is stated at cost,
net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

(ix) Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets that are acquired are recognised only if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable
to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of assets can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are recorded at cost of
acquisition including incidental costs related to acquisition and installation and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses, if any.
Gain or loss arising from derecognition of an intangible asset is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds
and the carrying amount of the intangible asset and is recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is
derecognised.

Subsequent costs
Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it
relates. All other expenditure on intangible assets is recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss, as incurred.

Amortisation
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives of 3 years using the straight-line
method. Amortisation is calculated on a pro-rata basis for assets purchased/ disposed during the period.
Amortisation method and useful life are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

Intangible assets under development
Cost of intangible assets under development as at the reporting date are disclosed as intangible assets under development. It is
stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

(x) Assets held for sale
The Company’s non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying amount of non-current
assets will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use and its sale is highly probable. The sale is considered
to be highly probable only when such non-current assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale is
expected to be complete within an year from the date of classification. Such non-current assets are measured at lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less cost to sell. If a newly acquired non-current asset meets the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale, such
non-current asset being measured on initial recognition at the lower of its carrying amount had it not been so classified (for example,
cost) and fair value less costs to sell. Losses on initial classification as assets held for sale and subsequent gain and losses on remeasurement are recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented
separately in the Standalone Balance Sheet.

(xi) Leases
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for aircraft and engines, equipment, leasehold land and buildings. The
Company assesses at the inception date whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

i)

Lease liabilities

		

At the commencement date, the Company measures the lease liabilities at the present value of the lease payments that are not
paid at that date. The lease liabilities include lease payments, payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term
reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate, exercise price of a purchase option, if the company is reasonably certain
to exercise that option, less any incentives receivable.

		

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that
rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate (IBR). The IBR is the rate of interest that the
Company would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of
a similar value to the right of use assets in a similar economic environment.

		

After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced by
the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a lease modification,
including modification in the lease term, lease payments or assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. The lease
liabilities are re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the
modification.

ii) Right of use assets
		

At the commencement date, the right of use assets are measured at cost. The cost includes an amount equal to the lease liabilities
plus any lease payments made before the commencement date and any initial direct costs, less any incentives received from
equipment manufacturer in terms of the same lease. An estimate of costs to be incurred in respect of redelivery obligation, in
accordance with the terms of the lease, is also included in the right of use assets at commencement date.

		

After the commencement date, the right of use assets are measured in accordance with the accounting policy for property, plant

for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
and equipment i.e. right of use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
Right of use assets are also correspondingly adjusted to reflect any re-measurement impact in the lease liabilities on account
of lease modification. The right of use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 2.(b) (xiv)
Impairment of non-financial assets.

iii) Lease Term
		

At the commencement date, the Company determines the lease term which represents non-cancellable period of initial lease for
which the asset is expected to be used, together with the periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease, if the
Company is reasonably certain at the commencement date to exercise the extension or termination option.

iv) Other Leases
		

Lease payments associated with any other leases which falls outside the purview of Ind AS 116, short term leases and leases
for which the underlying asset is of low value are charged to Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss on straight line basis over
the lease term or another systematic basis which is more representative of the pattern of use of underlying asset.

v) Sale and leaseback transactions
		

The right of use arising from leaseback is measured at the proportion of previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to
right of use retained by the Company. Where sale proceeds (net of maintenance obligation, if any) received are judged to reflect
the asset’s fair value, any gain or loss arising on disposal is recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss, to the
extent that it relates to the rights that have been transferred. Gains and losses that relate to the rights that have been retained
are included in the carrying amount of the right of use assets recognised at commencement of the lease. Where sale proceeds
(net of maintenance obligation, if any) received are not at the asset’s fair value, any below market terms are recognised as a
prepayment of lease payments, and above market terms are recognised as additional financing provided by the lessor.

vi) Depreciation
		

Depreciation on assets held as right of use assets is charged to Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis
from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right of use assets or the end of the lease term,
except for leased aircraft previously classified as finance leases under erstwhile Ind AS where depreciation is charged on useful
life of right of use assets.

		

Depreciation on right of use assets has been charged based on the following period:
Asset Head
Aircraft and engines
-	Aircraft and engines components including spare engines
-	Leased aircraft previously classified as finance lease under erstwhile Ind AS
-	Major inspection and overhaul costs (Refer to Note 2.(b) (xxi))

(xii) Incentive - non-refundable
Cash incentives
The Company receives non-refundable incentives in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and engines. In case of owned aircraft
and engines, incentives are recorded as a reduction to the cost of related aircraft and engines. In case of aircraft and engines held
under leases, the incentives are recorded as reduction to the carrying amount of right of use assets at the commencement of lease of
the respective aircraft and engine.
The Company also receives non-refundable milestone incentives from the engine manufacturer on achievement of certain milestones
relating to acquisition and delivery of aircraft. These milestone incentives are recorded as reduction to the carrying value of aircraft
and engines in case of owned aircraft and engines. In case of aircraft and engines held under leases, the incentives are recorded as
reduction to the carrying amount of right to use assets at the commencement of lease of the respective aircraft and engine.

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
Where the aircraft is held under finance lease as per erstwhile Ind AS, the milestone incentives are deferred and recognised under
the head ‘Other operating revenue’ in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss, on a straight line basis over the remaining initial
lease period of the respective aircraft for which the aircraft is expected to be used. In case of prepayment of finance lease obligations
for aircraft taken on finance lease and consequently taking the ownership of the aircraft, before the expiry of the lease term, the
unamortised balance of such deferred incentive is recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the aircraft.

Non-cash incentives
Non-cash incentives are recorded as and when due to the Company by setting up a deferred asset and a corresponding deferred
incentive. These incentives are recorded as a reduction to the cost of related aircraft and engines in case of owned aircraft. In case of
aircraft and engines held under leases, the incentives are recorded as reduction to the carrying amount of right of use assets at the
commencement of lease of the respective aircraft and engine.
The deferred asset explained above is reduced on the basis of utilisation of incentives against liability towards purchase of goods
and services.

(xiii) Inventories
Inventories primarily includes stores and spares and loose tools (other than those which meet the criteria of property, plant and
equipment) and in-flight inventories. Inventories are valued at lower of cost or Net Realisable Value (‘NRV’). Cost of inventories
comprise all costs of purchase after deducting non refundable rebates and discounts and all other costs incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost are assigned to individual items of inventory on the weighted average cost
basis. NRV for in-flight inventory is the estimated selling price of goods sold less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. NRV
for stores and spares and loose tools used in rendering of services are not written down below cost except in cases where the price of
such materials have declined and it is estimated that the cost of rendering of services will exceed their selling price. Where necessary,
due allowance is made for all damaged, obsolete and slow moving items. The comparison of cost and net realisable value is made
on an item by item basis at each reporting date.

(xiv) Impairment - non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any
indication of impairment. If any such indication of impairment exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For impairment
testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating units (CGUs).
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based
on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an
asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit and
Loss.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Such a reversal
is made only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,
net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

(xv) Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Employee benefit liabilities such as salaries, wages and bonus, etc. that are expected to be settled wholly within twelve months after
the end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees’ services up
to the end of the reporting period and are measured at an undiscounted amount expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.

Post-employment benefit plans
Defined contribution plans
The Company pays provident fund contributions to the appropriate government authorities. The Company has no further payment
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined contribution plans and the
contributions are recognised as employee costs when an employee renders the related service.

Annual Report 2022-23

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans of the Company comprises gratuity.
The Company has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a lump
sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment, of an amount based on the
respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment. Vesting occurs upon completion of five years of service. The gratuity plan of the
Company is unfunded.
The liability recognised in the Standalone Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the present value of the
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. The defined benefit obligation is calculated on the basis of an actuarial
valuation using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference
to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related
obligation.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation. This cost and
other costs are included in employee costs in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised
immediately in the Standalone Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in
which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from settlement or curtailments are recognised immediately
in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss as past service cost.

Other long-term employee benefits
i.
		

ii.
		

Compensated absences
The Company’s net obligation in respect of compensated absences is the amount of benefit to be settled in future, that employees
have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. The benefit is discounted to determine its present
value. The obligation is measured on the basis of an actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Remeasurements
are recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.
Others
The Company’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than post-employment benefits is the amount of
benefit to be settled in future, that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. The benefit
is discounted to determine its present value. The obligation is measured on the basis of an actuarial valuation using the projected
unit credit method. Remeasurements are recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

Share-based payment arrangements
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees under the Employee Stock
Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) is generally recognised as an employee stock option scheme expense, with a corresponding increase in
equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for
which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised
is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. The
increase in equity recognised in connection with a share based payment transaction is presented in the “Employee stock option
outstanding account”, as separate component in equity. For share-based payment awards with market conditions, the grant-date fair
value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected
and actual outcomes. At the end of each period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to be
vested based on the non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

(xvi) Provisions and contingent liabilities and assets
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be
made of the amount of the obligation.

Financial Statements

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
The Company has in its fleet aircraft on lease. As contractually agreed under the lease contracts (except for leases previously
classified as finance lease under erstwhile Ind AS), the aircraft have to be redelivered to the lessors at the end of the lease term
under stipulated contractual return conditions. The redelivery obligations are determined by management based on historical trends
and data, and are recorded under ‘provision for maintenance, redelivery and overhaul cost’ at the present value of expected outflow,
where effect of the time value of money is material with the corresponding value capitalised under ‘Right of use assets’.

Contingent liabilities and assets
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Where it is not probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent
liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Contingent assets are possible assets that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company.

(xvii) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers. Revenue towards satisfaction of a
performance obligation is measured at the transaction price (net of variable consideration such as discounts, incentives, performance
bonuses, price concessions, or other similar items, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer). Revenue excludes amounts
collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue from bundled contracts is recognised separately for each performance obligation based
on stand-alone selling price. Revenue is recorded provided the recovery of consideration is probable and determinable.

Passenger services
Passenger revenue is recognised on flown basis i.e. when the service is rendered, net of discounts given to the passengers, amount
collected on behalf of third parties, applicable taxes and airport levies such as passenger service fee, user development fee, etc., if
any. Fees charged for cancellation of flight tickets are recognised as revenue on rendering of the said service.
The Company considers whether it is a principal or agent in relation to services by considering whether it has a performance obligation

(xxi)	Supplementary rentals and aircraft repair and maintenance
Under certain lease arrangements of aircraft and engines, the Company accrues monthly expenses in the form of supplementary rentals
which are based on aircraft and engine utilisation that is calculated with reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during
each month. Accrual of Supplementary rentals are made for heavy maintenance visits, engine overhaul and landing gear overhaul for
aircraft and engines taken on lease (except for leased aircraft previously classified as finance lease under erstwhile Ind AS).
Aircraft repairs and maintenance includes additional accrual, beyond supplementary rentals, for the estimated future costs of engine
maintenance checks. These accruals are based on past trends for costs incurred on such events, future expected utilization of engine,
condition of the engine and expected maintenance interval and are recorded over the period of the next expected maintenance visit.
For leased assets classified as finance lease under erstwhile Ind AS, cost incurred for major inspection costs relating to engine and
airframe overhauls and other major components are recorded as separate component and depreciated over the lower of useful life of
the component or remaining useful life of the leased asset.

Recent accounting pronouncements
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian
Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:
i)
		

ii)
		

Ind AS 8 - Definition of accounting estimates
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the
correction of errors. It has also been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting
estimates.
Ind AS 1 - Disclosure of accounting policies
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for
entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and
adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.

iii)	Ind AS 12 - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
		

The amendments specify that that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’. Costs
that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour,
materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.

These amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s standalone financial
statements.

*It includes:
a.	Provision for redelivery obligation: The Company has in its fleet, aircraft on lease. As contractually agreed under certain lease
contracts, the aircraft have to be redelivered to the lessors at the end of the lease term under stipulated contractual return conditions.
The redelivery obligations are determined by management based on historical trends and data, and are capitalised at the present
value of expected outflow, where effect of the time value of money is material.
b.	Provision for overhaul expenses for certain aircraft held under lease are recorded at discounted value, where effect of the time value
of money is material.
c.	Provision for engine maintenance which represents additional accrual, beyond supplementary rentals, for the estimated future costs
of engine maintenance checks. These accruals are based on past trends for costs incurred on such events, future expected utilisation
of engine, condition of the engine and expected maintenance interval and are recorded over the period of the next expected
maintenance visit.
The measurement of the provision for redelivery and overhaul cost includes assumptions primarily relating to expected costs and discount
rates commensurate with the expected obligation maturity schedules. An estimate is therefore made to ensure that the provision
corresponds to the present value of the expected costs to be borne by the Company. Judgement is exercised by management given the
long-term nature of assumptions that go into the determination of the provision. The assumption made in relation to the current year are
consistent with those in the previous year.
Expected timing of resulting outflow of economic benefit is financial year 2023-24 to 2032-33 (previous year 2022-23 to 2031-32) and
the Company calculates the provision using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.

Sensitivity analysis for key assumptions used:
If expected cost differ by 10% from management’s estimate, while holding all other assumptions constant, the provision for maintenance,
redelivery and overhaul cost may increase / decrease by Rs. 984.94 (previous year by Rs. 802.38).
If expected discount rate differ by 1%, while holding all other assumptions constant, the provision for maintenance, redelivery and overhaul
cost may increase by Rs 87.77 (previous year Rs. 28.39) or decrease by Rs. 93.17 (previous year by Rs. 38.86).

* The fair values for security deposits forming part of other financial assets were calculated based on discounted cash flows using a current
lending rate. They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the inclusion of unobservable inputs including
counterparty credit risk.
** Non-current investments excludes investment in subsidiary which is carried at cost.
* **The fair values of supplementary rentals and aircraft maintenance are based on discounted cash flows using a current borrowing rate.
They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, including own credit risk.
There has been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 for the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.

Other financial assets and financial liabilities
The carrying amounts of trade receivables, trade payables, short-term borrowings (including interest accrued but not due), current financial
assets (excluding security deposits), cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents and unclaimed
dividend approximates the fair values, due to their short-term nature.
Long term borrowings have been contracted at floating rate of interest, which resets at short intervals. Accordingly, the carrying value of
such borrowings (including interest accrued but not due) approximates fair value as on the reporting date.
Non-current financial assets (excluding security deposits) represents bank deposits (due for maturity after twelve months from the
reporting date) and interest accrued but not due on financial instruments, the carrying value of which approximates the fair values as on
the reporting date.

Valuation technique used to determine fair value
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
- the use of NAV for mutual funds.
- the fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow method.

Risk management framework
The Board of Directors of the Company has formed a Risk Management Committee to frame, implement and monitor the risk management
plan for the Company. The committee is responsible for reviewing the risk management policies and ensuring its effectiveness.
The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company to set appropriate risks,
limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in
market conditions and the Company’s activities.
The Risk Management Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with Company’s risk management policies and
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risk faced by the Company.

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances is limited as the Company generally invests in deposits with financial
institutions with high credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. Investments primarily include investment in debt based mutual
fund units with low risk. Other financial assets majorly includes security deposits which primarily represents deposits given as pre delivery
payments to aircraft manufacturers. Such deposits will be returned to the Company on deliveries of the aircraft by the aircraft manufacturers
as per the contract. The credit risk associated with such security deposits is relatively low.
Trade receivables are generally unsecured and are derived from revenue earned (including applicable taxes and airport levies) from
customers primarily located in India and certain parts of Middle East and South Asia. Trade receivables also includes credit / debit card
receivables of the Company which are realisable within a period of 1 to 7 working days.
The Company monitors the economic environment in which it operates to manage its credit risk. The Company manages its credit risk
through various measures including establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring credit worthiness of customers to whom it
extends credit in the normal course of business.
The Company sells majority of its air transportation services against advances made by agents / customers and through online channels.
The Company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain. The Company uses a provision matrix to compute the
expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account available internal credit risk factors such as the
Company’s historical experience for customers. Based on the business environment in which the Company operates, management considers
that the trade receivables (other than receivables from government departments) are in default (credit impaired) if the payments are
more than 90 days past due, however, the Company based upon past trends determine an impairment allowance for loss on receivables
outstanding for more than 180 days past due.
Majority of trade receivables are from domestic customers, which are fragmented and are not concentrated to individual customers. Trade
receivables as at year end primarily includes Rs. 4,091.76 (previous year Rs. 2,199.81) relating to revenue generated from passenger
services and Rs. 1,191.32 (previous year Rs. 1,209.00) relating to revenue generated from cargo services.

payment behaviour.
# The Company based upon past trends determine an impairment allowance for loss on receivables outstanding for more than 180

realisable based on historical payment behaviour and hence, no loss allowance has been recognised, and from agents for which the
impairment allowance has already been recognised on specific credit risk factor.
The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances for the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is insignificant
and hence the same has not been recognised. The reversal for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances for the current year is

(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are
settled by delivering cash or another financial assets. The Company’s approach to manage liquidity is to have sufficient liquidity to meet
its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed circumstances, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage
to the Company’s reputation.
The Company believes that its liquidity position, comprising of total cash, bank deposits and investments (including amounts under lien) of
Rs. 233,513.31 as at March 31, 2023 (previous year Rs.181,499.35), anticipated future internally generated funds from operations, and its
fully available, revolving undrawn fund and non fund based credit facilities will enable it to meet its future known obligations in the ordinary
course of business. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had received revolving fund based credit line sanctions amounting to Rs. 58,805.30
(previous year Rs. 52,593.24), of which the Company has drawn Rs. 18,000.00 (previous year Rs. 34,805.65) and has undrawn revolving fund
based credit facilities of Rs. 40,805.30 (previous year Rs. 17,787.59). Additionally, the Company also has undrawn non fund based credit
facilities amounting to Rs. 77,016.20 (previous year Rs. 92,668.15). The Company does not believe a significant liquidity risk with regard to
its lease liabilities as the assets are sufficient to meet the obligations related to lease liabilities as and when they fall due. In addition to
this, the Company has unencumbered assets as well as access to adequate financing arrangements. Hence, in case a liquidity need were to
arise, the Company believes it has sufficient means to meet its ongoing capital, operating, and other liquidity requirements. The Company
will continue to consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as necessary.
The Company’s liquidity management process as monitored by management, includes the following:
-

Day to day funding, managed by monitoring future cash flows to ensure that requirements can be met.

-

Maintaining rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position on the basis of expected cash flows.

-

Maintaining diversified credit lines.

(iii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk
comprises two types of risks namely: currency risk and interest rate risk. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
A. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to certain bank deposits, foreign currency term
loan and certain lease liabilities carrying floating rate of interest.
Exposure to interest rate risk
The Company’s interest rate risk arises from certain bank deposits, foreign currency term loan and certain lease liabilities carrying floating
rate of interest. These deposits and obligations expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. The exposure of the Company to
interest rate changes as reported to the management at the end of the reporting period are as follows:
Variable-rate instruments
Financial liabilities
Foreign currency term loan- from others
Lease liabilities (previously classified as finance leases under erstwhile Ind AS)

The summary of quantitative data about the Company’s exposure to currency risk, as expressed in Indian Rupees, as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 are as below:

Exposure to foreign currency risk

Currency risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company is exposed to the effects of fluctuation in the
prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows. Exposure arises primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations between the functional currency and other currencies
from the Company’s operating, investing and financing activities.

Sensitivity analysis
A reasonably possible strengthening / (weakening) of the Indian Rupee against below currencies as at March 31, 2023 and
March 31, 2022 would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and affected Standalone
Statement of Profit and Loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis is performed on foreign currency denominated monetary financial
assets and financial liabilities outstanding as at the year end. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates,
remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases.

affects the adjustment to right of use assets by Rs. 105.42 (previous year Rs. 131.56). It is expected to impact the Standalone Statement
of Profit and Loss over the remaining life of the right of use assets as an adjustment to depreciation charge.

30. Capital management
The primary objective of the management of the Company’s capital structure is to maintain an efficient mix of debt and equity in order to
achieve a low cost of capital, while taking into account the desirability of retaining financial flexibility to pursue business opportunities
and adequate access to liquidity to mitigate the effect of unforeseen events on cash flows.
The Board of directors regularly review the Company’s capital structure in light of the economic conditions, business strategies and future
commitments.
Management monitors the return on equity and debt equity ratio which has been disclosed in Note 43.

31. Contingent liabilities (to the extent not provided for)
The Company is a party to various taxation disputes and legal claims, which are not acknowledged as debts. Significant management
judgement is required to ascertain that it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the taxation disputes and legal claims.

(i) Income tax
The income tax authority has assessed the return of income of the Company up to Assessment Year (“AY”) 2021-22 and has revised the
taxable income for certain years on account of disallowance of certain expenses and in respect of the tax treatment of certain incentives
received from the manufacturer in respect of acquisition of aircraft and engines. The Company has not yet received assessment orders for
subsequent years.
The Company has received favourable order against such disallowances/additions from the Special Bench of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
(“ITAT”) for AY 2012-13 and Divisional Bench of ITAT for certain years till AY 2015-16. However, the tax authority’s appeal against the order
of the Divisional Bench of ITAT for AY 2007-08, AY 2008-09 and AY 2009-10 and Special Bench of ITAT for AY 2012-13 is pending before
the Hon’ble High Court.
The Company believes, based on legal advice from counsels, that the view taken by ITAT Special Bench and Divisional Bench is sustainable
in higher courts and accordingly, no provision is required to be recorded in the books of account.
The tax exposure (excluding interest and penalty) for matters disallowed by income tax authorities up to AY 2021-22 i.e. the last year
assessed, amounts to Rs. 19,244.53 (previous year Rs. 14,029.94) in case the incentives are held to be taxable. The above amount is net
of Rs. 5,331.67 (previous year Rs. 5,331.67), which represents minimum alternate tax recoverable written off in the earlier years.

(ii)	The Company is in legal proceedings for various disputed legal matters related to Customs, Octroi, Service Tax, Integrated Goods and
Services Tax (‘IGST’) and Value Added Tax (‘VAT’). The amounts involved in these proceedings, not acknowledged as debt, are:
(1) Service Tax- Rs. 55.07 (previous year Rs. 144.71),
(2) Value Added Tax - Rs. 30.92 (previous year Rs. 30.92),
(3) Octroi - Rs. 74.39 (previous year Rs. 74.39) and
(4) IGST on re-imports* - Rs. 12,638.46 (previous year Rs. 10,616.39).
The Company believes, based on advice from counsels/experts, that the views taken by authorities are not sustainable and accordingly,
no provision is required to be recorded in the books of account.
* During the current year, the Company has paid Integrated Goods and Services Tax (“IGST”) amounting to Rs. 2,022.07 (previous year
Rs. 2,077.28) under protest, on re-import of repaired aircraft, aircraft engines and other certain aircraft parts, to Custom authorities and
therefore as at March 31, 2023, cumulative amount paid under protest is Rs. 12,638.46 (previous year Rs. 10,616.39), against which
appeals have been filed or to be filed before the Appellate authorities. In past, the Company had received favourable orders on this matter
from the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (“CESTAT”), New Delhi. However, the Customs authorities filed an appeal before
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the above-mentioned CESTAT orders. The matter is yet to be decided by the Supreme Court
and no stay on CESTAT orders has been granted by the Supreme Court till date. Further, the Customs authorities vide Customs amendment
notification dated July 19, 2021 (“Amendment Notification”) has amended earlier Customs exemption Notification to reiterate their
position that IGST is applicable on re-import of goods after repair. Based on the advice received from the legal counsels, we continue to
believe that, IGST is still not payable on such re-import of repaired aircraft, aircraft engines and other certain aircraft parts even after the
above-mentioned Amendment Notification. During the current year, the Company has filed a Writ Petition before the Hon’ble High Court of
Delhi challenging the constitutional validity of Amendment Notification. The matter is pending for disposal before the Hon’ble High Court
of Delhi. Accordingly, the above amounts paid under protest till March 31, 2023 have been shown as recoverable.

31. Contingent liabilities (to the extent not provided for) (Contd..)
(iii)	The Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) passed an order dated November 17, 2015 against, inter alia, the Company, imposing
a penalty of Rs. 637.40 on the Company on account of cartelization for determination of fuel surcharge included in the component of
Cargo services. The Company filed an appeal against this order before the Competition Appellate Tribunal and it referred the matter
back to the CCI for fresh adjudication. CCI passed a final order dated March 07, 2018 reducing the penalty amount on the Company
to Rs. 94.50. The Company has filed an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”) against the order
imposing penalty which is currently pending. The penalty imposed by CCI on the Company was stayed by NCLAT upon deposit of 10%
of the penalty amount.
The Company based on legal advice from the external counsel, believes that the views taken by authorities are challengeable and
accordingly, no provision is required to be recorded in the books of account at this stage.

(iv)	In February 2019, Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in its judgement clarified the applicability of allowances that should be considered to
measure obligations under Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952. There are interpretative challenges on the application of judgement
retrospectively and as such the Company does not consider that there is any probable obligations for past periods. Accordingly,
based on evaluation the Company has made a provision for provident fund contribution on prospective basis.

(v) Legal cases
As per the notification dated January 1, 2016, The Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Act, 2015 is applicable retrospectively w.e.f
April 1, 2014. In view of the partial stay granted by Karnataka and Kerala High Court, the impact of this amendment for the period
April 1, 2014 till March 31, 2015 amounting to Rs. 19.47 has not been acknowledged as debt.

(vi) Other legal proceedings for which the Company is contingently liable
The Company is party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business and does not expect the outcome of these proceedings
to have any adverse effect on the standalone financial statements and hence, no provision has been set-up against the same.
Notes:
Pending resolution of the respective proceedings, it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of cash outflows, if any,
in respect of the above as it is determinable only on receipt of judgements or decisions pending with various forums or authorities.
Accordingly, the above mentioned contingent liabilities are disclosed at undiscounted amount.

32. Commitments
Particulars
Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account and other
commitments, and not provided for in the books of account [net of advances Rs. 1,480.22
(previous year Rs. 322.07)]

As at
March 31, 2022

3,062,277.42

As on the reporting date, the Company expects that the estimated realisable value of these assets will exceed the commitment value net
of discounts, benefits and incentives which will accrue to the Company consequential to acquiring these assets.

33. Employee benefits
The Company contributes to the following post-employment benefit plans.

Defined contribution plan
The Company pays provident fund contributions to the appropriate government authorities at rate specified as per regulations.
An amount of Rs. 1,097.95 (previous year Rs. 917.54) has been recognised as an expense in respect of the Company’s contribution to
Provident Fund and the same has been deposited with the relevant authorities. It has been shown under employee costs in the Standalone
Statement of Profit and Loss.

33. Employee benefits (Contd..)
The sensitivity analysis is based on a change in above assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. The changes in some of the
assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the
same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting
year) has been applied, as has been applied when calculating the provision for defined benefit plan recognised in the Standalone Balance
Sheet.
The method and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous years.

Risk exposure:
The defined benefit plan is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Change in discount rates: A decrease in discount yield will increase plan liabilities.
Mortality table: The gratuity plan obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increase in life expectancy will result
in an increase in plan liabilities.

* During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Board of Directors had accepted resignation of Mr. Jiten Chopra from the post of Chief
Financial Officer of the Company effective March 28, 2022.
The Committee, upon a review of the remuneration structure for employees and with the desire to review and make a more market relevant
compensation structure of the senior management, recommended to the Board to not proceed further with the grant of outstanding 78,158
stock options earlier approved by the Committee on February 4, 2022. The same has been approved by Board at its meeting held on
February 2, 2023.
The risk-free interest rates are determined based on current yield to maturity of Government Bonds with 5-10 years residual maturity.
Expected volatility calculation is based on historical daily closing stock prices of competitors / Company using standard deviation of daily
change in stock price. The minimum life of stock option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised and the
maximum life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised. The expected life has been considered based on average sum
of maximum life and minimum life and may not necessarily be indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. Dividend yield has been
calculated taking into account expected rate of dividend on equity share price as on grant date basis past trends. For the measurement of
grant date fair value certain market conditions were considered in the method of valuation.

40.The Company has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents that are required by the
transfer pricing legislation under section 92-92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Since the law requires existence of such information and
documentation to be contemporaneous in nature, the Company is in the process of updating the documentation for the international
transactions entered into with the associated enterprises during the financial year and expects such records to be in existence latest
by due date as required under the law. The management is of the opinion that its international transactions with the associated
enterprises are at arm’s length so that the aforesaid legislation will not have any impact on the financial statements, particularly on
the amount of tax expense and that of provision for taxation.

consolidated Balance sheet as at March 31, 2023, the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive income,
the consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the
consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter
referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true
and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group,
as at March 31, 2023, their consolidated loss including other comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and the consolidated
statement of changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ‘Code of
Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the
responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report,
including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of audit procedures performed by us, including
those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

The determination of passenger revenue to be recognised for
each flight requires complex IT systems and involves high volume
of transactions.

established by the service provider) which govern revenue recognition,
and key manual internal controls over passenger revenue recognition,
including controls related to estimation of trends in respect of unused
tickets and testing of preventive controls over unauthorised override;
• performed tests of details such as tested revenue and collection
reconciliations of Group’s records with reports generated from
third party systems, tested manual journal entries posted into
relevant revenue accounts in the sub-ledger and general ledger
which met specified risk-based criteria;

We identified revenue recognition as a key audit matter because
passenger revenue is one of the Group’s key performance
indicators, it involves complicated IT systems that handle large
volumes of transaction data and includes exchange of information
with industry systems and partner airlines and the judgement
required by management in determining the unexercised rights of
passengers, all of which give rise to an inherent risk that revenue
could be recorded in the incorrect period or at incorrect amount.

•

analysed the terms related to passenger tickets and obtained
data supporting Group’s historical expiry trend in respect of unused
passenger tickets and tested a sample of ticket documents from
the source data to ascertain timing of the recognition they were
recorded and evaluated the judgements used in determining the
timing of the recognition of revenue from unexercised rights of
passengers;

•

performed tests to verify that the timing of passenger revenue
recognition was appropriate.
Lease accounting, incentives, and corresponding tax implications (refer note 17.b to the consolidated financial statements)
The Group operates certain new and used aircraft under lease Our audit procedures included but were not limited to:
arrangements.
• tested that the Group’s accounting policies are in compliance
For determination of the appropriate lease accounting under
Ind AS 116, basis classification of leases, sale and leaseback
transactions, and corresponding tax treatment, the Group has
considered the substance of the transaction rather than just the
legal form including among other factors, treatment of receipt of
non-refundable incentives in connection with acquisition of new
aircrafts.
We considered lease accounting, of aircraft and other leases
(including the corresponding tax treatment), as a key audit
matter due to significant judgement required in the assumptions
and estimates used to determine the Right of Use (ROU) asset
and lease liability, viz assessment of lease term (including
modification terms), determination of appropriate incremental
borrowing rate, treatment of non-refundable incentives received in
connection with the acquisition of the aircrafts and other assets in
ROU, componentisation of the ROU asset, and the tax treatment
of incentives involves a significant degree of management
judgement in interpreting the various relevant rules, regulations
and practices.

agreements (including modifications) and assessed management
judgements used in determining the classification of leases;

•

determining right of use assets and lease liabilities related to
lease contracts with underlying lease agreements including
related incentives received and performed computation checks
on the amount of lease liability and the right to use, tracing of
the same to bank statements, credit notes, underlying contracts/
documents;

•

assessed the inputs used for determination of the incremental
borrowing rate including, assessment of lease term by reference

respect of aircraft leased during the term of the lease.
• assessed the design, implementation and operating effectiveness
These arise from legal and contractual obligations relating to the
condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor.
At each reporting date, the calculation of the maintenance
provision includes a number of variable factors and assumptions
including likely utilisation of the aircraft; the expected cost of the
heavy maintenance check at the future date it is expected to occur;
the condition of the aircraft engine, contractual return conditions.
Given the involvement of inherent level of management judgement
required as a result of the complex and subjective element around
these variable factors and assumptions in order to quantify the
provision amounts, we have identified this as a key audit matter.

process including accounting for maintenance provisions for
aircraft held under operating leases;

by management in estimating the provisions and any changes
therein, and reviewed the terms of the operating leases, compared
assumptions to contract terms and the Group’s maintenance cost
experience;

to the expected future maintenance event dates from Group’s
appropriate personnel and assessed the consistency of the
provisions with the engineering department’s assessment of
the condition of aircraft, based on underlying engine borescope
inspections and results, analysis of historical flight hours,
estimate of the cost of maintenance work to historic invoices;

•

assessed the provision by ensuring that all significant return
condition obligations included in aircraft lease contracts have
been considered;

•

performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the Annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated
Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements
in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial
performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the
Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)
specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that
give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of
preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible
for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.

205

Annual Report 2022-23

Those respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting
process of the Group.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We also:
•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company
has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such
controls.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the
Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.

•

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group
of which we are the independent auditors, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial
statements of which we are the independent auditors. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated
financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd..)
Annexure 2 referred in Paragraph 2(F) under the heading “Report on Other Legal and Regulatory
Requirements” of our Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements of InterGlobe Aviation
Limited
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of InterGlobe Aviation Limited (hereinafter referred to as the
“Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to
consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary (the Holding Company and its subsidiary together referred
to as “the Group”).

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Group’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over
financial reporting criteria established by the Group considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Group’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of
reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group’s internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to consolidated
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these
financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over
financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to these consolidated financial statements,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to these consolidated financial statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to these Financial Statements
A Company’s internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd..)
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to these Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to these consolidated financial statements to future
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to these financial statements may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, the Group has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial
statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at
March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Group considering the essential
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

of air transportation and pre-flight and post flight ground handling operations which includes passenger and cargo services and providing
related allied services such as in-flight sales, business of ground handling and other allied services at the airports.

2.a Basis of preparation
(i) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind
AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and presentation
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), as applicable to the consolidated
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on accrual and going concern basis.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 18, 2023.

(ii) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except certain financial assets and liabilities
that are measured at fair value or amortised cost.

(iii) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
prospectively.
Information about significant areas of estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Note 2.(b) (xiv) and 33 - measurement of defined benefit obligations: key actuarial assumptions.
Note 2.(b) (ix) and (x) - judgement required to ascertain lease classification and fair value of assets including assets held for sale.

intangible assets.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
Note 38 - judgement required to determine grant date fair value.
Note 2.(b) (iii), (iv) and 29 - fair value measurement of financial instruments.
Note 2.(b) (xxii)- judgement required to determine probability of recognition of deferred tax assets.
Note 2.(b) (xvi) - judgement required to determine standalone price for each performance in bundled contracts.
Note 2.(b) (x) - judgement is required in determining the lease term of contracts with extension and termination options.
Note 2.(b) (x) and (iv) - estimation of the incremental borrowing rate.
There are no assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next
financial year.

(iv) Basis of consolidation
The Company consolidates entity which it owns or controls. The consolidated financial statements comprise the standalone financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiary as disclosed in Note 44. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its
power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those which
significantly affect the entity’s returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.
The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions
are eliminated upon consolidation. These consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in
use at the Group. Non-controlling interest which represents part of net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiary that are not, directly
or indirectly, owned or controlled by the Company, are excluded.

2.b Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements
except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change
in the accounting policy.

(i) Current - non-current classification
All assets and liabilities are classified into current and non-current.

Assets
An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:
•

it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the normal operating cycle of the respective company
of the Group;

•

it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;

•

it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or

•

it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after
the reporting period.

Current assets include the current portion of non-current assets. All other assets are classified as non-current.

Liabilities
A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:
•

it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle of the respective company of the Group;

•

it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;

•

it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
•

the respective company of the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12
months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the
issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.

Current liabilities include the current portion of non-current liabilities. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

Operating cycle
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents.
Based on the nature of operations and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and
cash equivalents, the respective company of the Group has ascertained its operating cycle being a period of 12 months for the
purpose of classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current.

(ii) Foreign currency transactions and translations
Functional and presentation currency
The management has determined the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates i.e., functional
currency, to be Indian Rupees (Rs.). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, which is the Group’s
functional and presentation currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest millions upto two decimal places, unless otherwise
stated.

Transactions and balances
Monetary and non-monetary transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the Group at the
exchange rates on the date of the transactions or at an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of
the transaction.
Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities remaining unsettled on reporting date are translated at the rates of exchange
prevailing on reporting date. Gains / (losses) arising on account of realisation / settlement of foreign exchange transactions and
on translation of monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
However, gains / (losses) arising on translation of certain lease liabilities which represents long-term foreign currency monetary loans
taken before March 31, 2016 and used for acquisition of depreciable right of use assets, are adjusted in the cost of respective item
of right of use assets. The treatment will continue till the repayment of the long-term foreign currency monetary loans.
Foreign exchange gains / (losses) arising on translation of foreign currency monetary loans are presented in the Consolidated Statement
of Profit and Loss on net basis. However, foreign exchange differences arising from foreign currency monetary loans to the extent
regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, within finance costs.

(iii) Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset
or transfer the liability takes place either:
-

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

-

In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to / by the Group.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within
the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a
whole:

220

•

Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

•

Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

•

Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature,
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, investments, at fair value at each reporting date. Also, fair value of financial
instruments measured at amortised cost is disclosed in Note 29.

(iv) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of
another entity.

Financial assets
Recognition and initial measurement
All financial assets are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All
financial assets, except trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, are initially measured at fair value
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction
price.
Classification and subsequent measurement
Classification
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, the Group classifies financial assets in following categories:
•

Financial assets at amortised cost

•

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

•

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset being ‘debt instrument’ is measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
•

The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and

•

The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are Solely Payments of Principal and
Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset being ‘debt instrument’ is measured at FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:
•

The asset is held within the business model, whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling
the financial assets, and

•

The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount
outstanding.

A financial asset being equity instrument is measured at FVTPL.
All financial assets, not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI as described above, are measured at FVTPL.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at amortised cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by
impairment losses, if any. Interest income and impairment are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Annual Report 2022-23

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
Financial assets at FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest income, are recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Financial assets at FVTOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers
the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the
financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership
and it does not retain control of the financial asset. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss.
Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)
The Group recognises loss allowances using the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for the financial assets which are not fair valued
through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to
lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there
has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition, in which case those financial assets are measured at lifetime ECL.
The changes (incremental or reversal) in loss allowance computed using ECL model, are recognised as an impairment gain or loss in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Write-off
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect
of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the counterparty does not have assets or sources of income
that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could
still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Financial liabilities
Recognition and initial measurement
All financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All
financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value minus, in the case of financial liabilities not recorded at fair value through profit
or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the liability.
Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial
recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Financial liabilities other than classified as FVTPL, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest expense are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.
The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified terms are
substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference
between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognised
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when, and only
when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or
to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	Compound financial instruments - convertible preference shares
Compound financial instruments issued by the Company comprises of convertible preference shares that can be converted to equity
shares of the Company.
Convertible preference shares are bifurcated into liability and equity components based on the terms of the contract.
The liability component of convertible preference shares is initially recognised at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have
an equity conversion option. The equity component is initially recognised at the difference between the fair value of the compound
financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to
the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. The equity component of convertible preference shares is not remeasured subsequently.
Interest related to the liability component is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. On conversion, the liability
component is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised.

(v) Share capital
Equity share capital
Issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as equity share capital in equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of
new equity shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

(vi) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises of cash at banks and on hand, cheques on hand and short-term deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

(vii) Property, plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if
any.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises: (a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; (b) any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate
component of property, plant and equipment. The Group has recognised major inspection costs relating to engine and airframe
overhauls and other heavy maintenance as separate components for owned aircraft, owned engines and leased aircraft previously
classified as finance leases under erstwhile Ind AS.
The cost of improvements to aircraft taken on lease except leased aircraft which were previously classified as finance leases under
erstwhile Ind AS, if recognition criteria are met, have been capitalised and disclosed separately as leasehold improvement - aircraft.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property, plant and equipment
(calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment) is
included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when property, plant and equipment is derecognised. The carrying amount
of any component accounted as a separate component is derecognised, when replaced or when the property, plant and equipment
to which the component relates gets derecognised.

Subsequent costs
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as separate assets, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that the future economic benefits associated with expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss at the time of
incurrence.

Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values and is charged to
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, except owned aircraft and spare engines,
rotables and non-aircraft equipment, leasehold improvements and leasehold improvements - aircraft, is provided on written down
value method at the rates and in the manner provided in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation on owned aircraft and
spare engines, rotables and non-aircraft equipment is provided on the straight line method at the rates and in the manner prescribed
in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
Major inspection costs relating to engine and airframe overhauls and other heavy maintenance are identified as separate components
for owned aircraft, owned engines and leased aircraft previously classified as finance leases under erstwhile Ind AS and are depreciated
over the expected lives between major overhauls and remaining useful life of the aircraft/engines, whichever is lower.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment has been charged based on the following useful lives:
Asset Head
Owned Aircraft and spare engines
- Aircraft and engine components including spare engines
- Major inspection and overhaul costs
Rotables and non-aircraft equipment*
Furniture and fixtures
Computer
- End user devices
- Server and networks
Office equipment
- Office equipment
- Electrical equipment
Ground support equipment
Motor vehicles (including ground support vehicles)

	* The life of the rotables is reassessed, the moment these are installed to the aircraft and are expected to be redelivered along with
the aircraft. Accordingly, the net carrying value of rotables are depreciated in the same period in which such aircraft is redelivered.
Expenditure incurred towards leasehold improvements - aircraft is depreciated on a straight line basis over the remaining period of the
lease of the aircraft or 5 years, whichever is lower.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight line basis over the period of the initial lease term or their estimated useful
life, whichever is lower.
Buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over the remaining period of the lease of land on which building is constructed or
60 years, whichever is lower.
The useful lives have been determined based on internal evaluation done by management and are in line with the estimated useful
lives, to the extent prescribed by the Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, in order to reflect the technological obsolescence and
actual usage of the asset. The residual values are not more than 5% of the original cost of the asset.
Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis for assets purchased / sold during the period.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed by management at each
reporting date and adjusted prospectively, as appropriate.

Capital work-in-progress
Property, plant and equipment not ready for use as at the reporting date are disclosed as capital work-in-progress. It is stated at cost,
net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

(viii) Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets that are acquired are recognised only if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable
to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of assets can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are recorded at cost of
acquisition including incidental costs related to acquisition and installation and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses, if any.
Gain or loss arising from derecognition of an intangible asset is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and
the carrying amount of the intangible asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is
derecognised.

Subsequent costs
Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it
relates. All other expenditure on intangible assets is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, as incurred.

Amortisation
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives of 3 years using the straight-line
method. Amortisation is calculated on a pro-rata basis for assets purchased/ disposed during the period.
Amortisation method and useful life are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

Intangible assets under development
Cost of intangible assets under development as at the reporting date are disclosed as intangible assets under development. It is
stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

(ix) Assets held for sale
The Group’s non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying amount of non-current
assets will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use and its sale is highly probable. The sale is considered
to be highly probable only when such non-current assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale is
expected to be complete within an year from the date of classification. Such non-current assets are measured at lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less cost to sell. If a newly acquired non-current asset meets the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale,
such non-current asset being measured on initial recognition at the lower of its carrying amount had it not been so classified (for
example, cost) and fair value less costs to sell. Losses on initial classification as assets held for sale and subsequent gain and losses
on re-measurement are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are
presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(x) Leases
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for aircraft and engines, equipment, leasehold land and buildings. The
Group assesses at the inception date whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

i)
		

Lease liabilities
At the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liabilities at the present value of the lease payments that are not
paid at that date. The lease liabilities include lease payments, payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term
reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate, exercise price of a purchase option, if the Group is reasonably certain to
exercise that option, less any incentives receivable.

225

InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Annual Report 2022-23

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
		

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate
cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate (IBR). The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group
would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar
value to the right of use assets in a similar economic environment.

		

After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced by
the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a lease modification,
including modification in the lease term, lease payments or assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. The lease
liabilities are re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the
modification.

ii) Right of use assets
		

At the commencement date, the right of use assets are measured at cost. The cost includes an amount equal to the lease liabilities
plus any lease payments made before the commencement date and any initial direct costs, less any incentives received from
equipment manufacturer in terms of the same lease. An estimate of costs to be incurred in respect of redelivery obligation, in
accordance with the terms of the lease, is also included in the right of use assets at commencement date.

		

After the commencement date, the right of use assets are measured in accordance with the accounting policy for property, plant
and equipment i.e. right of use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
Right of use assets are also correspondingly adjusted to reflect any re-measurement impact in the lease liabilities on account of
lease modification. The right of use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 2.(b) (xiii)
Impairment of non-financial assets.

iii) Lease Term
		

At the commencement date, the Group determines the lease term which represents non-cancellable period of initial lease for
which the asset is expected to be used, together with the periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease, if the
Group is reasonably certain at the commencement date to exercise the extension or termination option.

iv) Other Leases
		

Lease payments associated with any other leases which falls outside the purview of Ind AS 116, short term leases and leases for
which the underlying asset is of low value are charged to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on straight line basis over
the lease term or another systematic basis which is more representative of the pattern of use of underlying asset.

v) Sale and leaseback transactions
		

The right of use arising from leaseback is measured at the proportion of previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to
right of use retained by the Group. Where sale proceeds (net of maintenance obligation, if any) received are judged to reflect
the asset’s fair value, any gain or loss arising on disposal is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, to the
extent that it relates to the rights that have been transferred. Gains and losses that relate to the rights that have been retained
are included in the carrying amount of the right of use assets recognised at commencement of the lease. Where sale proceeds
(net of maintenance obligation, if any) received are not at the asset’s fair value, any below market terms are recognised as a
prepayment of lease payments, and above market terms are recognised as additional financing provided by the lessor.

vi) Depreciation
		

226

Depreciation on assets held as right of use assets is charged to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis
from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right of use assets or the end of the lease term,
except for leased aircraft previously classified as finance leases under erstwhile Ind AS where depreciation is charged on useful
life of right of use assets.

(xi) Incentive - non-refundable
Cash incentives
The Group receives non-refundable incentives in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and engines. In case of owned aircraft and
engines, incentives are recorded as a reduction to the cost of related aircraft and engines. In case of aircraft and engines held under
leases, the incentives are recorded as reduction to the carrying amount of right of use assets at the commencement of lease of the
respective aircraft and engine.
The Group also receives non-refundable milestone incentives from the engine manufacturer on achievement of certain milestones
relating to acquisition and delivery of aircraft. These milestone incentives are recorded as reduction to the carrying value of aircraft
and engines in case of owned aircraft and engines. In case of aircraft and engines held under leases, the incentives are recorded as
reduction to the carrying amount of right to use assets at the commencement of lease of the respective aircraft and engine.
Where the aircraft is held under finance lease as per erstwhile Ind AS, the milestone incentives are deferred and recognised under the
head ‘Other operating revenue’ in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, on a straight line basis over the remaining initial
lease period of the respective aircraft for which the aircraft is expected to be used. In case of prepayment of finance lease obligations
for aircraft taken on finance lease and consequently taking the ownership of the aircraft, before the expiry of the lease term, the
unamortised balance of such deferred incentive is recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the aircraft.

Non-cash incentives
Non-cash incentives are recorded as and when due to the Group by setting up a deferred asset and a corresponding deferred
incentive. These incentives are recorded as a reduction to the cost of related aircraft and engines in case of owned aircraft. In case of
aircraft and engines held under leases, the incentives are recorded as reduction to the carrying amount of right of use assets at the
commencement of lease of the respective aircraft and engine.
The deferred asset explained above is reduced on the basis of utilisation of incentives against liability towards purchase of goods
and services.

(xii) Inventories
Inventories primarily includes stores and spares and loose tools (other than those which meet the criteria of property, plant and
equipment) and in-flight inventories. Inventories are valued at lower of cost or Net Realisable Value (‘NRV’). Cost of inventories
comprise all costs of purchase after deducting non refundable rebates and discounts and all other costs incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost are assigned to individual items of inventory on the weighted average cost
basis. NRV for in-flight inventory is the estimated selling price of goods sold less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. NRV
for stores and spares and loose tools used in rendering of services are not written down below cost except in cases where the price of
such materials have declined and it is estimated that the cost of rendering of services will exceed their selling price. Where necessary,
due allowance is made for all damaged, obsolete and slow moving items. The comparison of cost and net realisable value is made
on an item by item basis at each reporting date.

(xiii) Impairment - non- financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication of impairment exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For impairment testing, assets
are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of
the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating units (CGUs).

227

InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Annual Report 2022-23

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based
on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an
asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Such a reversal
is made only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,
net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

(xiv) Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Employee benefit liabilities such as salaries, wages and bonus, etc. that are expected to be settled wholly within twelve months after
the end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees’ services up
to the end of the reporting period and are measured at an undiscounted amount expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.

Post-employment benefit plans
Defined contribution plans
The Group pays provident fund contributions to the appropriate government authorities. The Group has no further payment obligations
once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined contribution plans and the contributions are
recognised as employee costs when an employee renders the related service.
Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans of the Group comprises gratuity.
The Group has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for
a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment, of an amount
based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment. Vesting occurs upon completion of five years of service.
The gratuity plan of the Group is unfunded.
The liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. The defined benefit obligation is calculated on the basis of an actuarial valuation
using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference
to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related
obligation.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation. This cost and
other costs are included in employee costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised
immediately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period
in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from settlement or curtailments are recognised immediately
in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as past service cost.

Other long-term employee benefits
i.

Compensated absences

The Group’s net obligation in respect of compensated absences is the amount of benefit to be settled in future, that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The
obligation is measured on the basis of an actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Remeasurements are recognised
in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

Others

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than post-employment benefits is the amount of benefit
to be settled in future, that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. The benefit is
discounted to determine its present value. The obligation is measured on the basis of an actuarial valuation using the projected unit
credit method. Remeasurements are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

Share-based payment arrangements
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees under the Employee Stock
Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) is generally recognised as an employee stock option scheme expense, with a corresponding increase in
equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for
which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised
is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. The
increase in equity recognised in connection with a share based payment transaction is presented in the “Employee stock option
outstanding account”, as separate component in equity. For share-based payment awards with market conditions, the grant-date fair
value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected
and actual outcomes. At the end of each period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to be
vested based on the non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

(xv) Provisions and contingent liabilities and assets
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
The Group has in its fleet aircraft on lease. As contractually agreed under the lease contracts (except for leases previously classified as
finance lease under erstwhile Ind AS), the aircraft have to be redelivered to the lessors at the end of the lease term under stipulated
contractual return conditions. The redelivery obligations are determined by management based on historical trends and data, and are
recorded under ‘provision for maintenance, redelivery and overhaul cost’ at the present value of expected outflow, where effect of the
time value of money is material with the corresponding value capitalised under ‘Right of use assets’.

Contingent liabilities and assets
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent
liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Contingent assets are possible assets that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

(xvi) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers. Revenue towards satisfaction of a
performance obligation is measured at the transaction price (net of variable consideration such as discounts, incentives, performance
bonuses, price concessions, or other similar items, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer). Revenue excludes amounts
collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue from bundled contracts is recognised separately for each performance obligation based
on stand-alone selling price. Revenue is recorded provided the recovery of consideration is probable and determinable.

Passenger services
Passenger revenue is recognised on flown basis i.e. when the service is rendered, net of discounts given to the passengers, amount
collected on behalf of third parties, applicable taxes and airport levies such as passenger service fee, user development fee, etc., if
any. Fees charged for cancellation of flight tickets are recognised as revenue on rendering of the said service.
The Group considers whether it is a principal or agent in relation to services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to
provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for services to be provided by a third party, such as another
carrier or a third party.
The Group sells certain tickets with connecting flights with one or more segments operated by its other airline partners. For segments
operated by its other airline partners, the Group has determined that every partner airline is responsible for their portion of the
contract (i.e. transportation of the passenger). The Group recognises revenue for the segment operated by the Group at the selling
price of the ticket net of the amount transferrable to the other airline partner. The amount transferrable to the other airline partner for
its segment is recognised as a financial liability.
Tickets sold by other airlines where the Group provides the transportation are recognised as passenger revenue at the estimated
value to be billed to the other airline when the services are provided as per contract.
The Group recognises an expected breakage amount as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer.
Breakage revenue represents the amount of unexercised rights of customers which are non-refundable in nature.
The consideration from sale of tickets not yet flown is credited to unearned revenue i.e. ‘Forward Sales’ disclosed under other current
liabilities. The unutilised balance in Forward Sales for more than an year is recognised as revenue based on historical statistics, data
and management estimates and considering the Group’s cancellation policy.

Cargo services
Cargo revenue is recognised when service is rendered i.e. goods are transported, net of discounts, amount collected on behalf of third
parties, airport levies and applicable taxes.

In flight sales
Revenue from sale of merchandise and food and beverages is recognised on transfer of goods to passengers, net of applicable taxes.

Tours and packages
Income and related expense from sale of tours and packages are recognised upon services being rendered and where applicable, are
stated net of discounts and applicable taxes. The income and expense are stated on gross basis.
The sale of tours and packages not yet serviced is credited to unearned revenue, i.e. ‘Forward Sales’ disclosed under other current
liabilities.

Government grants
Grants from the government are recognised where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will
comply with all attached conditions. The grant which is revenue in nature is recognised as other operating income on a systematic
basis over the period for which such grant is entitled.

Interest income
Interest income on financial assets (including deposits with banks) is recognised using the effective interest method on a time
proportionate basis.

Claims and other credits - non-refundable
Claims relating to reimbursement towards operational expenses such as lease rentals, aircraft repair and maintenance, etc, are
adjusted against such expenses over the estimated period for which these reimbursements pertains. When credits are used against
purchase of goods and services such as lease rentals, aircraft repair and maintenance, etc, these are adjusted against such expenses
on utilization basis. The claims and credits are netted off against related expense arising on the same transaction as it reflects the
substance of transaction. Further, any claim or credit not related to reimbursement towards operational expenses or used for purchase

of goods and services are recognised as income in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when a contractual entitlement
exists, the amount can be reliably measured and receipt is virtually certain.

Customer Loyalty Programme
The Group operates a rewards programme in partnership with credit card companies and this programme is referred as ‘Co-Branded
Card’. The Co-Branded Card provides points to its members on spending from the card as per the agreement. Reward points are
redeemable by the members in the future periods for travel with the Group. Revenue against the reward points is recognised when
redeemed by the members for travel with Group on flown basis. Reward points which remain unredeemed at the time of expiry of such
points is recognised in Other Income. Consideration value received from Co- Branded card companies is recognised as other current
liabilities till its redemption / expiry.
The Group recognises fees and other incidental charges collected under such programme under the head “Other Income” by allocating
them to the separately identifiable performance obligations.

(xvii) Commission
The incentives / commission attributable to sales / services made through agents/ customers is recognised on rendering of services to
customers which is in accordance with the terms of contracts.

(xviii) Expenditure
Expenses are accounted for on the accrual basis and provisions are made for all known losses and liabilities.

(xix) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for intended use. Other borrowing costs
are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing cost includes exchange differences to the extent
regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.

(xx)	Supplementary rentals and aircraft repair and maintenance
Under certain lease arrangements of aircraft and engines, the Group accrues monthly expenses in the form of supplementary rentals
which are based on aircraft and engine utilisation that is calculated with reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during
each month. Accrual of Supplementary rentals are made for heavy maintenance visits, engine overhaul and landing gear overhaul for
aircraft and engines taken on lease (except for leased aircraft previously classified as finance lease under erstwhile Ind AS).
Aircraft repairs and maintenance includes additional accrual, beyond supplementary rentals, for the estimated future costs of engine
maintenance checks. These accruals are based on past trends for costs incurred on such events, future expected utilization of engine,
condition of the engine and expected maintenance interval and are recorded over the period of the next expected maintenance visit.
For leased assets classified as finance lease under erstwhile Ind AS, cost incurred for major inspection costs relating to engine and
airframe overhauls and other major components are recorded as separate component and depreciated over the lower of useful life of
the component or remaining useful life of the leased asset.
Aircraft maintenance covered by third party maintenance agreements, wherein the cost is charged to the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss at a contractual rate per hour in accordance with the terms of the agreements. The Group recognises aircraft repair and
maintenance cost (other than major inspection costs) in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on incurred basis.

(xxi) Aircraft fuel expense
Aircraft fuel expenses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as uplifted and consumed, net of any discounts.

(Rupees in millions, except for share data and if otherwise stated)

Current tax
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable
or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received
after considering the uncertainty, if any relating to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates enacted for the relevant reporting period.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts,
and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses,
unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets unrecognised or recognised, are reviewed at each reporting date and are
recognised / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Significant management judgement is required to determine the probability of deferred tax asset.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or liability is settled,
based on the applicable laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the
reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and
assets levied by the same tax authorities.

(xxiii) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its equity shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average
number of equity shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting profit/(loss) attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of equity
shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.

(xxiv) Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Board of Directors who makes strategic decisions and is responsible for
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.

(xxv) Dividend
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the
Company, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

(xxvi) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that management considers, by virtue of their size or incidence, should be disclosed separately
to ensure that the financial information allows an understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year, so as to
facilitate comparison with prior periods. Also, tax charges related to exceptional items and certain one-time tax effects, if any are
considered exceptional. Such items are material by nature or amount to the year’s result and require separate disclosure in accordance
with Ind AS.

Recent accounting pronouncements
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian
Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:
i)
		

ii)
		

Ind AS 8 - Definition of accounting estimates
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the
correction of errors. It has also been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting
estimates.
Ind AS 1 – Disclosure of accounting policies
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for
entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and
adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.

iii)	Ind AS 12 - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
		

The amendments specify that that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’. Costs
that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour,
materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.

These amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements.

*It includes:
a.

Provision for redelivery obligation: The Group has in its fleet, aircraft on lease. As contractually agreed under certain lease contracts,
the aircraft have to be redelivered to the lessors at the end of the lease term under stipulated contractual return conditions. The
redelivery obligations are determined by management based on historical trends and data, and are capitalised at the present value
of expected outflow, where effect of the time value of money is material.

b.

Provision for overhaul expenses for certain aircraft held under lease are recorded at discounted value, where effect of the time value
of money is material.

c.

Provision for engine maintenance which represents additional accrual, beyond supplementary rentals, for the estimated future costs
of engine maintenance checks. These accruals are based on past trends for costs incurred on such events, future expected utilisation
of engine, condition of the engine and expected maintenance interval and are recorded over the period of the next expected
maintenance visit.

The measurement of the provision for redelivery and overhaul cost includes assumptions primarily relating to expected costs and discount
rates commensurate with the expected obligation maturity schedules. An estimate is therefore made to ensure that the provision
corresponds to the present value of the expected costs to be borne by the Group. Judgement is exercised by management given the
long-term nature of assumptions that go into the determination of the provision. The assumption made in relation to the current year are
consistent with those in the previous year.
Expected timing of resulting outflow of economic benefit is financial year 2023-24 to 2032-33 (previous year 2022-23 to 2031-32) and
the Group calculates the provision using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.

Sensitivity analysis for key assumptions used:
If expected cost differ by 10% from management’s estimate, while holding all other assumptions constant, the provision for maintenance,
redelivery and overhaul cost may increase / decrease by Rs. 984.94 (previous year by Rs. 802.38).
If expected discount rate differ by 1%, while holding all other assumptions constant, the provision for maintenance, redelivery and overhaul
cost may increase by Rs 87.77 (previous year Rs. 28.39) or decrease by Rs. 93.17 (previous year by Rs. 38.86).

* The fair values for security deposits forming part of other financial assets were calculated based on discounted cash flows using a current
lending rate. They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the inclusion of unobservable inputs including
counterparty credit risk.
* *The fair values of supplementary rentals and aircraft maintenance are based on discounted cash flows using a current borrowing rate.
They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, including own credit risk.
There has been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 for the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.

Other financial assets and financial liabilities
The carrying amounts of trade receivables, trade payables, short-term borrowings (including interest accrued but not due), current financial
assets (excluding security deposits), cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents and unclaimed
dividend approximates the fair values, due to their short-term nature.
Long term borrowings have been contracted at floating rate of interest, which resets at short intervals. Accordingly, the carrying value of
such borrowings (including interest accrued but not due) approximates fair value as on the reporting date.
Non-current financial assets (excluding security deposits) represents bank deposits (due for maturity after twelve months from the
reporting date) and interest accrued but not due on financial instruments, the carrying value of which approximates the fair values as on
the reporting date.

Valuation technique used to determine fair value
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
–

the use of NAV for mutual funds

–

the fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow method.

Valuation processes
The finance department of the Group includes a team that performs the valuations of financial assets and liabilities required for financial
reporting purposes, including level 3 fair values. This team reports directly to the Senior Management. Discussions on valuation and results are
held between the Senior Management and valuation team at least once every quarter in line with the Group’s quarterly reporting periods.

b. Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
•

Credit risk ;

•

Liquidity risk ;

•

Market Risk - Foreign currency ; and

•

Market Risk - Interest rate

Risk management framework
The Board of Directors of the Group has formed a Risk Management Committee to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan
for the Group. The committee is responsible for reviewing the risk management policies and ensuring its effectiveness.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group to set appropriate risks, limits
and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market
conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Risk Management Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with Group’s risk management policies and procedures
and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risk faced by the Group.

(i) Credit risk
The maximum exposure to credit risks is represented by the total carrying amount of these financial assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances is limited as the Group generally invests in deposits with financial
institutions with high credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. Investments primarily include investment in debt based mutual
fund units with low risk. Other financial assets majorly includes security deposits which primarily represents deposits given as pre delivery
payments to aircraft manufacturers. Such deposits will be returned to the Group on deliveries of the aircraft by the aircraft manufacturers as
per the contract. The credit risk associated with such security deposits is relatively low.
Trade receivables are generally unsecured and are derived from revenue earned (including applicable taxes and airport levies) from
customers primarily located in India and certain parts of Middle East and South Asia. Trade receivables also includes credit / debit card
receivables of the Group which are realisable within a period of 1 to 7 working days.
The Group monitors the economic environment in which it operates to manage its credit risk. The Group manages its credit risk through
various measures including establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring credit worthiness of customers to whom it extends credit
in the normal course of business.
The Group sells majority of its air transportation services against advances made by agents / customers and through online channels.
The Group uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain. The Group uses a provision matrix to compute the
expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account available internal credit risk factors such as
the Group’s historical experience for customers. Based on the business environment in which the Group operates, management considers
that the trade receivables (other than receivables from government departments) are in default (credit impaired) if the payments are
more than 90 days past due, however, the Group based upon past trends determine an impairment allowance for loss on receivables
outstanding for more than 180 days past due.
Majority of trade receivables are from domestic customers, which are fragmented and are not concentrated to individual customers. Trade
receivables as at year end primarily includes Rs. 4,091.76 (previous year Rs. 2,199.81) relating to revenue generated from passenger
services and Rs. 1,191.32 (previous year Rs. 1,209.00) relating to revenue generated from cargo services.

* The Group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historical
payment behaviour.
 The Group based upon past trends determine an impairment allowance for loss on receivables outstanding for more than 180 days past
#
due. Receivables more than 180 days past due primarily comprises receivables from government departments, which are fully realisable
based on historical payment behaviour and hence, no loss allowance has been recognised and from agents for which the impairment
allowance has already been recognised on specific credit risk factor.
The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances for the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is insignificant
and hence the same has not been recognised. The reversal for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances for the current year is
Rs. Nil (previous year Rs. Nil.)

(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are
settled by delivering cash or another financial assets. The Group’s approach to manage liquidity is to have sufficient liquidity to meet its
liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed circumstances, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to
the Group’s reputation.
The Group believes that its liquidity position, comprising of total cash, bank deposits and investments (including amounts under lien)
of Rs. 234,243.03 as at March 31, 2023 (previous year Rs.182,275.34), anticipated future internally generated funds from operations,
and its fully available, revolving undrawn fund and non fund based credit facilities will enable it to meet its future known obligations in
the ordinary course of business. As of March 31, 2023, the Group had received revolving fund based credit line sanctions amounting to
Rs. 58,805.30 (previous year Rs. 52,593.24), of which the Group has drawn Rs. 18,000.00 (previous year Rs. 34,805.65) and has undrawn
revolving fund based credit facilities of Rs. 40,805.30 (previous year Rs. 17,787.59). Additionally, the Group also has undrawn non fund
based credit facilities amounting to Rs. 77,016.20 (previous year Rs. 92,668.15). The Group does not believe a significant liquidity risk
with regard to its lease liabilities as the assets are sufficient to meet the obligations related to lease liabilities as and when they fall due.
In addition to this, the Group has unencumbered assets as well as access to adequate financing arrangements. Hence, in case a liquidity
need were to arise, the Group believes it has sufficient means to meet its ongoing capital, operating, and other liquidity requirements.
The Group will continue to consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as
necessary.
The Group’s liquidity management process as monitored by management, includes the following:
–

Day to day funding, managed by monitoring future cash flows to ensure that requirements can be met.

–

Maintaining rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity position on the basis of expected cash flows.

–

Maintaining diversified credit lines.

credit / standby letter of credit which are backed by deposits / mutual funds liened to financial institutions.

(iii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk
comprises two types of risks namely: currency risk and interest rate risk. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
A. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to certain bank deposits, foreign currency term loan
and certain lease liabilities carrying floating rate of interest.

Exposure to interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from certain bank deposits, foreign currency term loan and certain lease liabilities carrying floating
rate of interest. These deposits and obligations expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The exposure of the Group to interest
rate changes as reported to the management at the end of the reporting period are as follows:
Variable-rate instruments
Financial liabilities
Foreign currency term loan- from others
Lease liabilities (previously classified as finance leases under erstwhile Ind AS)

Particulars

As at March 31, 2023

The summary of quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to currency risk, as expressed in Indian Rupees, as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 are as below:

Exposure to foreign currency risk

Currency risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to the effects of fluctuation in the
prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows. Exposure arises primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations between the functional currency and other currencies
from the Group’s operating, investing and financing activities.

Sensitivity analysis
A reasonably possible strengthening / (weakening) of the Indian Rupee against below currencies as at March 31, 2023 and
March 31, 2022 would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and affected Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis is performed on foreign currency denominated monetary financial
assets and financial liabilities outstanding as at the year end. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates,
remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases.

affects the adjustment to right of use assets by Rs. 105.42 (previous year Rs. 131.56). It is expected to impact the Consolidated Statement
of Profit and Loss over the remaining life of the right of use assets as an adjustment to depreciation charge.

30. Capital management
The primary objective of the management of the Group’s capital structure is to maintain an efficient mix of debt and equity in order to
achieve a low cost of capital, while taking into account the desirability of retaining financial flexibility to pursue business opportunities
and adequate access to liquidity to mitigate the effect of unforeseen events on cash flows.
The Board of directors regularly review the Group’s capital structure in light of the economic conditions, business strategies and future
commitments.
Management monitors the return on equity and debt equity ratio which has been disclosed in Note 43.

31. Contingent liabilities (to the extent not provided for)
The Group is a party to various taxation disputes and legal claims, which are not acknowledged as debts. Significant management
judgement is required to ascertain that it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the taxation disputes and legal claims.

(i) Income tax
The income tax authority has assessed the return of income of the Group up to Assessment Year (“AY”) 2021-22 and has revised the
taxable income for certain years on account of disallowance of certain expenses and in respect of the tax treatment of certain incentives
received from the manufacturer in respect of acquisition of aircraft and engines. The Group has not yet received assessment orders for
subsequent years.
The Group has received favourable order against such disallowances/additions from the Special Bench of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
(“ITAT”) for AY 2012-13 and Divisional Bench of ITAT for certain years till AY 2015-16. However, the tax authority’s appeal against the order
of the Divisional Bench of ITAT for AY 2007-08, AY 2008-09 and AY 2009-10 and Special Bench of ITAT for AY 2012-13 is pending before
the Hon’ble High Court.
The Group believes, based on legal advice from counsels, that the view taken by ITAT Special Bench and Divisional Bench is sustainable
in higher courts and accordingly, no provision is required to be recorded in the books of account.
The tax exposure (excluding interest and penalty) for matters disallowed by income tax authorities up to AY 2021-22 i.e. the last year
assessed, amounts to Rs. 19,244.53 (previous year Rs. 14,029.94) in case the incentives are held to be taxable. The above amount is net
of Rs. 5,331.67 (previous year Rs. 5,331.67), which represents minimum alternate tax recoverable written off in the earlier years.

(ii) The Group is in legal proceedings for various disputed legal matters related to Customs, Octroi, Service Tax, Integrated Goods and
Services Tax (‘IGST’) and Value Added Tax (‘VAT’). The amounts involved in these proceedings, not acknowledged as debt, are:
(1) Service Tax- Rs. 55.07 (previous year Rs. 144.71),
(2) Value Added Tax - Rs. 30.92 (previous year Rs. 30.92),
(3) Octroi - Rs. 74.39 (previous year Rs. 74.39) and
(4) IGST on re-imports* - Rs. 12,638.46 (previous year Rs. 10,616.39).
The Group believes, based on advice from counsels/experts, that the views taken by authorities are not sustainable and accordingly, no
provision is required to be recorded in the books of account.
*During the current year, the Group has paid Integrated Goods and Services Tax (“IGST”) amounting to Rs. 2,022.07 (previous year
Rs. 2,077.28) under protest, on re-import of repaired aircraft, aircraft engines and other certain aircraft parts, to Custom authorities and
therefore as at March 31, 2023, cumulative amount paid under protest is Rs. 12,638.46 (previous year Rs. 10,616.39), against which
appeals have been filed or to be filed before the Appellate authorities. In past, the Group had received favourable orders on this matter
from the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (“CESTAT”), New Delhi. However, the Customs authorities filed an appeal before
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the above-mentioned CESTAT orders. The matter is yet to be decided by the Supreme Court
and no stay on CESTAT orders has been granted by the Supreme Court till date. Further, the Customs authorities vide Customs amendment
notification dated July 19, 2021 (“Amendment Notification”) has amended earlier Customs exemption Notification to reiterate their
position that IGST is applicable on re-import of goods after repair. Based on the advice received from the legal counsels, we continue to
believe that, IGST is still not payable on such re-import of repaired aircraft, aircraft engines and other certain aircraft parts even after the

above-mentioned Amendment Notification. During the current year, the Group has filed a Writ Petition before the Hon’ble High Court of
Delhi challenging the constitutional validity of Amendment Notification. The matter is pending for disposal before the Hon’ble High Court
of Delhi. Accordingly, the above amounts paid under protest till March 31, 2023 have been shown as recoverable.
(iii) The Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) passed an order dated November 17, 2015 against, inter alia, the Group, imposing a
penalty of Rs. 637.40 on the Group on account of cartelization for determination of fuel surcharge included in the component of Cargo
services. The Group filed an appeal against this order before the Competition Appellate Tribunal and it referred the matter back to the CCI
for fresh adjudication. CCI passed a final order dated March 07, 2018 reducing the penalty amount on the Group to Rs. 94.50. The Group
has filed an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”) against the order imposing penalty which is currently
pending. The penalty imposed by CCI on the Group was stayed by NCLAT upon deposit of 10% of the penalty amount.
The Group based on legal advice from the external counsel, believes that the views taken by authorities are challengeable and accordingly,
no provision is required to be recorded in the books of account at this stage.
(iv) In February 2019, Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in its judgement clarified the applicability of allowances that should be considered
to measure obligations under Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952. There are interpretative challenges on the application of judgement
retrospectively and as such the Group does not consider that there is any probable obligations for past periods. Accordingly, based on
evaluation the Group has made a provision for provident fund contribution on prospective basis.

(v) Legal cases
As per the notification dated January 1, 2016, The Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Act, 2015 is applicable retrospectively w.e.f
April 1, 2014. In view of the partial stay granted by Karnataka and Kerala High Court, the impact of this amendment for the period April 1,
2014 till March 31, 2015 amounting to Rs. 19.47 has not been acknowledged as debt.

(vi) Other legal proceedings for which the Group is contingently liable
The Group is party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business and does not expect the outcome of these proceedings
to have any adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements and hence, no provision has been set-up against the same.
Notes:
Pending resolution of the respective proceedings, it is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timings of cash outflows, if any,
in respect of the above as it is determinable only on receipt of judgements or decisions pending with various forums or authorities.
Accordingly, the above mentioned contingent liabilities are disclosed at undiscounted amount.

32. Commitments
Particulars
Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account and other
commitments, and not provided for in the books of account [net of advances
Rs. 1,725.75 (previous year Rs. 322.07)]

As at
March 31, 2023

As at
March 31, 2022

3,062,448.41

As on the reporting date, the Group expects that the estimated realisable value of these assets will exceed the commitment value net of
discounts, benefits and incentives which will accrue to the Group consequential to acquiring these assets.

33. Employee benefits
The Group contributes to the following post-employment benefit plans.

Defined contribution plan
The Group pays provident fund contributions to the appropriate government authorities at rate specified as per regulations.
An amount of Rs. 1,427.16 (previous year Rs. 1,167.17) has been recognised as an expense in respect of the Group’s contribution
to Provident Fund and the same has been deposited with the relevant authorities. It has been shown under employee costs in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

33. Employee benefits (Contd..)
The sensitivity analysis is based on a change in above assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. The changes in some of the
assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the
same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting
year) has been applied, as has been applied when calculating the provision for defined benefit plan recognised in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
The method and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous years.

Risk exposure:
The defined benefit plan is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Change in discount rates: A decrease in discount yield will increase plan liabilities.
Mortality table: The gratuity plan obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increase in life expectancy will result
in an increase in plan liabilities.

38. Share-based payment arrangements (Contd..)
The Committee, upon a review of the remuneration structure for employees and with the desire to review and make a more market relevant
compensation structure of the senior management, recommended to the Board to not proceed further with the grant of outstanding 78,158
stock options earlier approved by the Committee on February 4, 2022. The same has been approved by Board at its meeting held on
February 2, 2023.
The risk-free interest rates are determined based on current yield to maturity of Government Bonds with 5-10 years residual maturity.
Expected volatility calculation is based on historical daily closing stock prices of competitors / Company using standard deviation of daily
change in stock price. The minimum life of stock option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised and the
maximum life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised. The expected life has been considered based on average sum
of maximum life and minimum life and may not necessarily be indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. Dividend yield has been
calculated taking into account expected rate of dividend on equity share price as on grant date basis past trends. For the measurement of
grant date fair value certain market conditions were considered in the method of valuation.

(f) Mr. Petrus Johannes Theodorus Elbers has joined as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective September 6, 2022.

40. The Group has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents that are required by the transfer
pricing legislation under section 92-92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Since the law requires existence of such information and
documentation to be contemporaneous in nature, the Group is in the process of updating the documentation for the international
transactions entered into with the associated enterprises during the financial year and expects such records to be in existence latest
by due date as required under the law. The management is of the opinion that its international transactions with the associated
enterprises are at arm’s length so that the aforesaid legislation will not have any impact on the financial statements, particularly on
the amount of tax expense and that of provision for taxation.

41. No funds have been advanced or loaned or invested by the Group to or in any other person(s) or entity(ies), including foreign
entities (“Intermediaries”) with the understanding, that the Intermediary shall lend or invest in party identified by or on behalf of the
